Lord Huron,"I am not the only traveler<br/>
Who has not repaid his debt<br/>
I've been searching for a trail to follow again<br/>
Take me back to the night we met<br/>
<br/>
And then I can tell myself<br/>
What the hell I'm supposed to do<br/>
And then I can tell myself<br/>
Not to ride along with you<br/>
<br/>
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you<br/>
Take me back to the night we met <br/>
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you<br/>
Oh, take me back to the night we met<br/>
<br/>
When the night was full of terrors<br/>
And your eyes were filled with tears<br/>
When you had not touched me yet<br/>
Oh, take me back to the night we met<br/>
<br/>
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you<br/>
Take me back to the night we met<br/>
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you<br/>
Take me back to the night we met

Sam Smith,"You must think that I'm stupid<br/>
You must think that I'm a fool<br/>

In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br/>

And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br/>

I know you're thinking I'm cold<br/>

Ed Sheeran,"Walking down 29th and park<br/>
I saw you in another's arms<br/>
Only a month we've been apart<br/>
You look happier<br/>

Saw you walk inside a bar<br/>
He said something to make you laugh<br/>
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours<br/>
Yeah you look happier, you do<br/>
<br/>
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br/>
But ain't nobody love you like I do<br/>
Promise that I will not take it personal baby<br/>
If you're moving on with someone new<br/>
<br/>
Cause baby you look happier, you do<br/>
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too<br/>
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth<br/>
But I know I was happier with you<br/>
<br/>
Sat in the corner of the room<br/>
Everything's reminding me of you<br/>
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier<br/>
Aren't you?<br/>
<br/>
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br/>
But ain't nobody need you like I do<br/>
I know that there's others that deserve you<br/>
But my darling I am still in love with you<br/>
<br/>
But I guess you look happier, you do<br/>
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too<br/>
I could try to smile to hide the truth<br/>
But I know I was happier with you<br/>
<br/>
Baby you look happier, you do<br/>

Just know that I'll be waiting here for you

You take me to places I've never known<br/>
And you push me to places I'll never go<br/>
I would die for you<br/>

Am I all that you would need?<br/>
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me<br/>
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you<br/>

You got me shot down by love<br/>

Oh I've been knocked down by you<br/>
You got my heart now<br/>
Why won't you stop now?<br/>
<br/>
I've been through it whole<br/>
I've been through the worst<br/>
But I never knew how much our love could hurt<br/>
Over my family I put you first<br/>
Riding on my feelings is the only thing that work<br/>
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too<br/>
But I hold on to the poems I would write you<br/>
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three<br/>
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku<br/>
<br/>
You got me shot down by love<br/>
And you got my heart now<br/>
Why won't you stop now?<br/>

Who wrote the book on goodbye?<br/>
There's never been a way to make this easy<br/>
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right<br/>
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire<br/>
<br/>
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty<br/>
Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head<br/>
Though I know that our time is ending<br/>
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed<br/>
<br/>
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind<br/>
Give me one more night<br/>

And the stars, they broke their code<br/>

How I landed on this road<br/>
I'm caught in between<br/>
What I wish and what I know<br/>
When they say that you just know<br/>

Ruth B.,"There was a time when I was alone<br/>
Nowhere to go and no place to call home<br/>
My only friend was the man in the moon<br/>
And even sometimes he would go away too<br/>
<br/>
Then one night, as I closed my eyes,<br/>
I saw a shadow flying high<br/>
He came to me with the sweetest smile<br/>
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile<br/>
He said, ""Peter Pan. That's what they call me.<br/>
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""<br/>
And ever since that day...<br/>
<br/>
I am a lost boy from Neverland<br/>
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan<br/>
And when we're bored we play in the woods<br/>
Always on the run from Captain Hook<br/>
""Run, run, lost boy,"" they say to me,<br/>
""Away from all of reality.""<br/>
<br/>
Neverland is home to lost boys like me<br/>
And lost boys like me are free<br/>
Neverland is home to lost boys like me<br/>
And lost boys like me are free<br/>
<br/>
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe<br/>
Believe in him and believe in me<br/>
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green<br/>
To your beautiful destiny<br/>
As we soared above the town that never loved me<br/>
I realized I finally had a family<br/>
Soon enough we reached Neverland<br/>
Peacefully my feet hit the sand<br/>
And ever since that day...<br/>

Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on<br/>

I heard you reap only what you'll sow<br/>
How could I never let you know?<br/>
