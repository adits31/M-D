The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing all right
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

Now, I can't say I'll be all right without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Heres what I'll do

I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you"

14,Khalid,Coaster,"As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the holes
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me"

18,Sabrina Claudio,Stand Still,"Time stands still
While we stand here
Don't wanna fight you
I need the same as you

I want trust to
I want us too
I want lust too
I want lust too
I want love too
I want this too
I want in you

Time is being wasted screaming
Not listen I promise you'll heal me better
You're so unaware about the feeling
The same thing, the same damn thing

Time is standing still
And why are we still here
I don't wanna fight you
I'm needing the same as you

I want trust too
I want us too
I want lust too
I want lust too
I want love too
I want this too
I want in you"
19,Xavier Omär,Runnin' Round,-1
20,Eli Sostre,Let You Go,"You're just tryna figure where I'm at
I'ma always tell you what I lack love
Fuck with me, I'm only talkin' facts
I've been drinkin' lately, I might act up
Jewelry on, I used to rock my brother chains
I was broke, they wanted me to stay the same
Fuck it bet, she bust it open for some change
Brought the family with me, feelin' like the Waynes
Get the fuck up out my face with all these questions
Did it on my own so I don't need suggestions
Hit the road, it'd been a minute since I checked in
Now you miss me, I just hope you're out there reppin'
Pretty bitch, she keep my picture on the wall, yeah
If you love me, hope you love me and my flaws, yeah
I wouldn't trade this feelin' for the world
Only right, I throwed some diamonds on my girl
Yeah, yeah
 
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go, oh oh oh
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go, oh oh oh

Tell me what you heard about
Tell me all the stories that you heard about
Say I'm fuckin' around, but that's just word to mouth
Used to want forever, you ain't sure now
Yeah, let's get connected, get connected
Yeah, them niggas talkin' down, yeah, they're talkin' reckless
Homie, I would hate it too lookin' at my neckless
Every time they hit my town, they're gon' need protection
Baby, back to you
Cell phone keep ringin' out the new
I got drugs in my bag, that's for you
If you tell a story on me tell the truth
Oh, yeah
 
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go, oh oh oh
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go"
21,Sevdaliza,Hubris,"Oh, my man
I hold your heart
Oh, pretend

You ain't my
And oh, I don't know you
Anymore

Anymore
You (?)

Oh, my man
I hold your heart
Oh, pretend
You ain't my (?)
And oh, I don't know you
Anymore, anymore

We'll fail
To see

We'll fail
To fly"

30,Geoffroy,Sleeping on My Own,"You ain't the first one to care for what's hiding inside
Ain't the first to fall
To notice you can't have it all

I ain't a cold hearted man, won't give you false hopes
But I ain't made of stone
Got limits, I'll get weak if you get too close

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own

You got me faded, stuck in a daze
Trying to keep up with your pace but I'm growing old
Guess I'm getting tired

And I've been meaning to tell you, what's been on my mind
I'm just scared you'll leave, been left alone too many times

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own"

38,Wet,Don't Wanna Be Your Girl,"I don't wanna be your girl no more
No more
I just wanna see your face at home
Home

You can't do me right
So I decide that

I don't wanna be your girl no more
No more
I just wanna see you up and out
Out of the door

I'm not living right
So I decide that

I don't wanna be your girl no more
No more
I won't hide the ways I've tried
It's just not right
It's killing me tonight"

43,Xavier Omär,If This Is Love,"Why are we here?
Why are we wasting all of this time now?
Let me be clear baby
You won't be stressing me in my prime now
You need to speak to me better
Talk to me like I'm worth a damn
You could be treating me better
And I could be doing well on my on now, now, now
You say baby

""Hold me tight
Don't let go
Ease my mind
Keep me close
Hold me tight""

You're so subjective
This don't reflect what you give me

(Oh)
You're so subjective

If this is love
I don't want it
I don't need it
I could live without it

Oh I thought that I was okay
(Ain't I) treat you all the best ways?
(Ain't I) there whenever you call?
(Ain't I) check my tone when we don't agree
And I watch my words like a hawk?
(Ain't I) make it right when I'm wrong?
(Ain't I) stay away from whatcha' don't like?
(Ain't I?)
It's super fake that you can't relate

You need to speak to me better
Trying to hide the truth
You've got all these expectations but they don't apply to you
I'm not here for it
I don't wan't that for myself
I could be doing well on my own now, now, now
You say baby

""Hold me tight
Don't let go
Ease my mind
Keep me close
Hold me tight""

You're so subjective
This don't reflect what you give me

If this is love
I don't want it
I don't need it
I could live without it"

46,Bonobo;Rhye,Break Apart,"It's hard to take all of this hate
It's hard to take all of this hate, this hate
First move they think they never saw
Be careful with me, be careful with
Join with me

I should've heard your fear
So, it's on me, so, it's on
I should've heard your needs
So, it's on, so, it's on, so, it's on

We've thrown apart these pieces
We've thrown apart these pieces
So, I don't go home
Tell me love, tell me love

You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
You're my

Instead of something to break apart
Instead, it's just broke apart
Stand up and shake this heart
Instead, it's just a break apart from us

I should've heard your fear
Shame on me
I should've heard your needs
Shame on me

Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out"

50,Silk Rhodes,Pains,"Now that it's over I can finally see
That all things must change and remain
Like I know you do, oh
People come and go
There is something you should know
Please don't explain
It's the same refrain
Yes it might be strange
Love can get changed
You make my thoughts come alive
Now I'm here to stay
Not to play these games
Nothing is for sure
I'd rather let you go
All things must change and remain
Growing Pains"
