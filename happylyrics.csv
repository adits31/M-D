"Uh-huh huh huhhh*LBT*
Let me tell ya now*LBT*
Uh-huh*LBT*
(Mmhhmmm)*LBT*
*LBT*
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around*LBT*
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd*LBT*
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took*LBT*
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look*LBT*
*LBT*
Oh baby, give me one more chance*LBT*
(To show you that I love you)*LBT*
Won't you please let me back in your heart*LBT*
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go*LBT*
(Let you go, baby)*LBT*
But now since I see you in his arms*LBT*
(I want you back)*LBT*
Yes I do now*LBT*
(I want you back)*LBT*
Ooh ooh baby*LBT*
(I want you back)*LBT*
Yeah yeah yeah yeah*LBT*
(I want you back)*LBT*
Na na na na*LBT*
*LBT*
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night*LBT*
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right*LBT*
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground*LBT*
Following the girl I didn't even want around*LBT*
*LBT*
Let me tell ya now*LBT*
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance*LBT*
(To show you that I love you)*LBT*
Won't you please let me back in your heart*LBT*
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go*LBT*

All I want...*LBT*
All I need...*LBT*
All I want!*LBT*
All I need!*LBT*
*LBT*
Oh, just one more chance*LBT*
To show you that I love you*LBT*
Baby baby baby baby baby baby!*LBT*
(I want you back)*LBT*
Forget what happened then*LBT*
(I want you back)*LBT*
And let me live again!*LBT*
*LBT*
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go*LBT*
But now since I see you in his arms*LBT*

"I need love, love*LBT*
To ease my mind*LBT*
I need to find, find someone to call mine*LBT*
But mama said*LBT*
*LBT*
You can't hurry love*LBT*
No, you just have to wait*LBT*
She said love don't come easy*LBT*
It's a game of give and take*LBT*
*LBT*
You can't hurry love*LBT*
No, you just have to wait*LBT*
You got to trust, give it time*LBT*
No matter how long it takes*LBT*
*LBT*
But how many heartaches*LBT*
Must I stand before I find a love*LBT*
To let me live again*LBT*
Right now the only thing*LBT*
That keeps me hangin' on*LBT*
When I feel my strength, yeah*LBT*
It's almost gone*LBT*
I remember mama said:*LBT*
*LBT*
You can't hurry love*LBT*
No, you just have to wait*LBT*
She said love don't come easy*LBT*
It's a game of give and take*LBT*
*LBT*
How long must I wait*LBT*
How much more can I take*LBT*
Before loneliness will cause my heart*LBT*
Heart to break?*LBT*
*LBT*
No I can't bear to live my life alone*LBT*
I grow impatient for a love to call my own*LBT*
But when I feel that I, I can't go on*LBT*
These precious words keeps me hangin' on*LBT*
I remember mama said:*LBT*
*LBT*
You can't hurry love*LBT*
No, you just have to wait*LBT*
She said love don't come easy*LBT*
It's a game of give and take*LBT*

No, you just have to wait*LBT*
She said trust, give it time*LBT*
No matter how long it takes*LBT*
*LBT*
No, love, love don't come easy*LBT*
But I keep on waiting*LBT*
Anticipating for that soft voice*LBT*
To talk to me at night*LBT*
For some tender arms*LBT*
To hold me tight*LBT*
I keep waiting*LBT*
I keep on waiting*LBT*
But it ain't easy*LBT*
It ain't easy*LBT*
But mama said:*LBT*
*LBT*
You can't hurry love*LBT*
No, you just have to wait*LBT*
She said to trust, give it time*LBT*
No matter how long it takes*LBT*
*LBT*
You can't hurry love*LBT*
No, you just have to wait*LBT*
She said love don't come easy*LBT*

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of*LBT*
Long before I knew*LBT*
Someone warm like you*LBT*
Would make my dreams come true*LBT*

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me*LBT*
Not like it's hurt me before*LBT*
For once, I have something I know won't desert me*LBT*

"Music is a world within itself*LBT*
With a language we all understand*LBT*
With an equal opportunity*LBT*
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands*LBT*
But just because a record has a groove*LBT*
Don't make it in the groove*LBT*
But you can tell right away at letter A*LBT*

They can feel it all over*LBT*
They can feel it all over people*LBT*
They can feel it all over*LBT*

Music knows it is and always will*LBT*
Be one of the things that life just won't quit*LBT*
But here are some of music's pioneers*LBT*
That time will not allow us to forget*LBT*
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo*LBT*
And the king of all Sir Duke*LBT*
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out*LBT*
There's no way the band can lose*LBT*
