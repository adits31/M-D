Lyrics
"I am not the only traveler*LBT*
Who has not repaid his debt*LBT*
I've been searching for a trail to follow again*LBT*
Take me back to the night we met*LBT*
*LBT*
And then I can tell myself*LBT*
What the hell I'm supposed to do*LBT*
And then I can tell myself*LBT*
Not to ride along with you*LBT*
*LBT*
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you*LBT*
Take me back to the night we met *LBT*
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you*LBT*
Oh, take me back to the night we met*LBT*
*LBT*
When the night was full of terrors*LBT*
And your eyes were filled with tears*LBT*
When you had not touched me yet*LBT*
Oh, take me back to the night we met*LBT*
*LBT*
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you*LBT*
Take me back to the night we met*LBT*
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you*LBT*
Take me back to the night we met

*LBT**LBT*"
"You must think that I'm stupid*LBT*
You must think that I'm a fool*LBT*
You must think that I'm new to this*LBT*
But I have seen this all before*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm never gonna let you close to me*LBT*
Even though you mean the most to me*LBT*
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts*LBT*
So I'm never gonna get too close to you*LBT*
Even when I mean the most to you*LBT*
In case you go and leave me in the dirt*LBT*
*LBT*
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry*LBT*
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry*LBT*
And every time you walk out, the less I love you*LBT*
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm way too good at goodbyes*LBT*
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)*LBT*
I'm way too good at goodbyes*LBT*
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)*LBT*
*LBT*
I know you're thinking I'm heartless*LBT*
I know you're thinking I'm cold*LBT*
I'm just protecting my innocence*LBT*
I'm just protecting my soul*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm never gonna let you close to me*LBT*
Even though you mean the most to me*LBT*
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts*LBT*
So I'm never gonna get too close to you*LBT*
Even when I mean the most to you*LBT*
In case you go and leave me in the dirt*LBT*
*LBT*
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry*LBT*
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry*LBT*
And every time you walk out, the less I love you*LBT*
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm way too good at goodbyes*LBT*
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)*LBT*
I'm way too good at goodbyes*LBT*
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)*LBT*
No way that you'll see me cry*LBT*
(No way that you'll see me cry)*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm way too good at goodbyes*LBT*
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)*LBT*
No*LBT*
No, no, no, no, no*LBT*

"Tell me pretty lies,*LBT*
Look me in the face,*LBT*
Tell me that you love me,*LBT*
Even if it's fake,*LBT*
'Cause I don't fucking care, at all*LBT*

I act like I don't fucking care,*LBT*
'Cause I'm so fucking scared*LBT*

I'm only a fool for you,*LBT*

"Walking down 29th and park*LBT*
I saw you in another's arms*LBT*
Only a month we've been apart*LBT*
You look happier*LBT*
*LBT*
Saw you walk inside a bar*LBT*
He said something to make you laugh*LBT*
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours*LBT*
Yeah you look happier, you do*LBT*
*LBT*
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you*LBT*
But ain't nobody love you like I do*LBT*
Promise that I will not take it personal baby*LBT*
If you're moving on with someone new*LBT*
*LBT*
Cause baby you look happier, you do*LBT*
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too*LBT*
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth*LBT*
But I know I was happier with you*LBT*
*LBT*
Sat in the corner of the room*LBT*
Everything's reminding me of you*LBT*
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier*LBT*
Aren't you?*LBT*
*LBT*
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you*LBT*
But ain't nobody need you like I do*LBT*
I know that there's others that deserve you*LBT*
But my darling I am still in love with you*LBT*
*LBT*
But I guess you look happier, you do*LBT*
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too*LBT*
I could try to smile to hide the truth*LBT*
But I know I was happier with you*LBT*
*LBT*
Baby you look happier, you do*LBT*
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new*LBT*
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do*LBT*
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you

*LBT**LBT*"
"Somebody said you got a new friend*LBT*
But does she love you better than I can?*LBT*
And there's a big black sky over my town*LBT*
I know where you're at I bet she's around*LBT*
*LBT*
And yeah I know it's stupid*LBT*
But I just gotta see it for myself*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm in the corner watching you kiss her*LBT*
Oh, oh, oh*LBT*
And I'm right over here. Why can't you see me?*LBT*
Oh, oh, oh*LBT*
And I'm givin' it my all*LBT*
But I'm not the guy you're taking home*LBT*
Oh*LBT*
I keep dancing on my own*LBT*
*LBT*
I just wanna dance all night*LBT*
And I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line*LBT*
Stilettos and broken bottles*LBT*
I'm spinning around in circles*LBT*
*LBT*
And I'm in the corner watching you kiss her*LBT*
Oh, oh, oh*LBT*
And I'm right over here. Why can't you see me?*LBT*
Oh, oh, oh*LBT*
And I'm giving it my all*LBT*
But I'm not the guy you're taking home*LBT*
Oh*LBT*
I keep dancing on my own*LBT*
And oh, no, no*LBT*
*LBT*
So far away*LBT*
But still so near*LBT*
The lights come on*LBT*
The music dies*LBT*
But you don't see me standing here*LBT*
I just came to say goodbye*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm in the corner watching you kiss her*LBT*
Oh, oh, oh*LBT*
And I'm giving it my all*LBT*
But I'm not the guy you're taking home*LBT*
Oh*LBT*
I keep dancing on my own*LBT*
And oh, no*LBT*
*LBT*
Said, I'm in the corner watching you kiss her*LBT*
Oh, no*LBT*
And I'm right over here. Why can't you see me?*LBT*
Oh, no*LBT*
And I'm giving it my all*LBT*
But I'm not the guy you're taking home*LBT*
Ooh*LBT*
And I keep dancing on my own*LBT*
*LBT*
So far away*LBT*
But still so near*LBT*
The lights come on*LBT*
The music dies*LBT*
But you don't see me standing here

*LBT**LBT*"
"You've been here before, surrounded in the cold*LBT*
You take me to places I've never known*LBT*
And you push me to places I'll never go*LBT*
I would die for you*LBT*
Tell me the truth*LBT*
Am I all that you would need?*LBT*
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me*LBT*
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you*LBT*
*LBT*
You got me shot down by love*LBT*
You got my heart now*LBT*
I want to stop now*LBT*
Oh I've been knocked down by you*LBT*
You got my heart now*LBT*
Why won't you stop now?*LBT*
*LBT*
I've been through it whole*LBT*
I've been through the worst*LBT*
But I never knew how much our love could hurt*LBT*
Over my family I put you first*LBT*
Riding on my feelings is the only thing that work*LBT*
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too*LBT*
But I hold on to the poems I would write you*LBT*
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three*LBT*
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku*LBT*
*LBT*
You got me shot down by love*LBT*
And you got my heart now*LBT*
Why won't you stop now?*LBT*
Oh I've been knocked down by you*LBT*
And you got my heart now*LBT*
Why won't you stop now?*LBT*
*LBT*
Knocked down, knocked down*LBT*
Knocked down, knocked down*LBT*
Knocked down*LBT*
Knocked down*LBT*
*LBT*
I've been shot down by love*LBT*
You got my heart now*LBT*
Why won't you stop now?*LBT*
I've been knocked down by you*LBT*
And you got my heart now*LBT*
Why won't you stop now?

"The note you wrote upon a shell*LBT*
The frozen air in Silverdale*LBT*
My heart is breaking by the shore*LBT*
And I couldn't give you anymore*LBT*
*LBT*
And I'm still shaking*LBT*
And crawling back again*LBT*
And all my brothers*LBT*
And all my sisters are gone*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm sorry that I let you go*LBT*
I'm sorry that I cared*LBT*
I'm sorry that the feeling shows*LBT*
But I just wasn't there*LBT*
I'm reminded of the fool I was*LBT*
I cut you off and fucked it up again*LBT*
I'm sorry that I let you go*LBT*
I'm sorry that I cared*LBT*
*LBT*
This pillow case it smells of you*LBT*
And time itself it stops to prove*LBT*
That for a moment nothings changed*LBT*
And everything just stays the same*LBT*
*LBT*
And I'm still shaking*LBT*
And crawling back again*LBT*
And all my brothers*LBT*
And all my sisters are gone*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm sorry that I let you go*LBT*
I'm sorry that I cared*LBT*
I'm sorry that the feeling shows*LBT*
But I just wasn't there*LBT*
I'm reminded of the fool I was*LBT*
I cut you off and fucked it up again*LBT*
I'm sorry that I let you go*LBT*
I'm sorry that I cared*LBT*
*LBT*
I left the light on*LBT*
So you could see me from the dark*LBT*
But then it blinded us*LBT*
And left us where we are*LBT*
*LBT*
I'm sorry that I let you go*LBT*
I'm sorry that I cared*LBT*
I'm sorry that the feeling shows*LBT*
but i just wasn't there*LBT*
I'm reminded of the fool I was*LBT*
I cut you off and fucked it up again*LBT*
I'm sorry that I let you go*LBT*
I'm sorry that I cared

*LBT**LBT*"
"Why did you leave me here to burn?*LBT*
I'm way too young to be this hurt*LBT*
I feel doomed in hotel rooms*LBT*
Staring straight up at the wall*LBT*
Counting wounds and I am tryin' to numb them all*LBT*
*LBT*
Do you care, do you care?*LBT*
Why don't you care?*LBT*
I gave you all of me*LBT*
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears*LBT*
Why don't you care, why don't you care?*LBT*
I was there, I was there, when no one was*LBT*
Now you're gone and I'm here*LBT*
*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
Number one, tell me who you think you are?*LBT*
You've got some nerve tryin' to tear my faith apart*LBT*
(I have questions for you)*LBT*
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?*LBT*
I should have never, ever, ever trusted you*LBT*
(I have questions)*LBT*
Number three, why weren't you, who you swore that you would be?*LBT*
I have questions, I've got questions haunting me*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
I have questions for you (I have questions)*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
*LBT*
My, my name was safest in your mouth*LBT*
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?*LBT*
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound*LBT*
But it sounds so dangerous to me now*LBT*
*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
Number one, tell me who you think you are?*LBT*
You've got some nerve tryin' to tear my faith apart*LBT*
(I have questions for you)*LBT*
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?*LBT*
I should have never, ever, ever trusted you*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
I have questions for you (I have questions)*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*

Do you care, do you care?*LBT*
Why don't you care?*LBT*
I gave you all of me*LBT*
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears*LBT*
Why don't you care, why don't you care?*LBT*
I was there, I was there, when no one was*LBT*
Now you're gone and I'm here*LBT*
*LBT*
I have questions for you, ooh*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
I have questions for you (I have questions)*LBT*
I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)*LBT*
I have questions for you, ooh*LBT*
I have questions for you (fair play, no, fair play, no)*LBT*
I have questions for you (I have questions)*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
I have questions for you*LBT*
*LBT*
How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it?*LBT*
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)*LBT*
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?*LBT*
I have questions

*LBT**LBT*"
"One, two*LBT*
*LBT*
Baby really hurt me*LBT*
Crying in the taxi*LBT*
He don't wanna know me*LBT*
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm*LBT*
Says it was poison*LBT*
So I guess I'll go home*LBT*
Into the arms of the girl that I love*LBT*
The only love I haven't screwed up*LBT*
She's so hard to please*LBT*
But she's a forest fire*LBT*
I do my best to meet her demands*LBT*
Play at romance, we slow dance*LBT*
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see*LBT*
Is one girl swaying alone*LBT*
Stroking her cheek*LBT*
*LBT*
They say, ""You're a little much for me*LBT*
You're a liability*LBT*
You're a little much for me""*LBT*
So they pull back, make other plans*LBT*
I understand, I'm a liability*LBT*
Get you wild, make you leave*LBT*
I'm a little much for*LBT*
E-a-na-na-na, everyone*LBT*
*LBT*
The truth is I am a toy*LBT*
That people enjoy*LBT*
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore*LBT*
And then they are bored of me*LBT*
I know that it's exciting*LBT*
Running through the night, but*LBT*
Every perfect summer's*LBT*
Eating me alive until you're gone*LBT*
Better on my own*LBT*

They say, ""You're a little much for me*LBT*
You're a liability*LBT*
You're a little much for me""*LBT*

Disappear into the sun*LBT*
You're all gonna watch me*LBT*
Disappear into the sun

"So I heard you found somebody else*LBT*
And at first I thought it was a lie*LBT*
I took all my things that make sounds*LBT*
The rest I can do without*LBT*
*LBT*
I don't want your body*LBT*
But I hate to think about you with somebody else*LBT*
Our love has gone cold*LBT*
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else*LBT*

I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone*LBT*
And then leaving with somebody else*LBT*
No, I don't want your body*LBT*
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else*LBT*

Come on baby*LBT*
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face*LBT*
Come on baby*LBT*
You said you'd find someone to take my place*LBT*

Oh I just don't believe that you have got it in you cause*LBT*
We are just gonna keep ""doin' it"" and everytime*LBT*
I start to believe in anything you're saying*LBT*
I'm reminded that I should be getting over it*LBT*

I don't want your body*LBT*

"I've been drunk three times this week*LBT*
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment*LBT*
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off*LBT*
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop*LBT*
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago*LBT*
When I was living how I wanna on my own*LBT*
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much*LBT*
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch*LBT*

I'm fucked up, I'm faded*LBT*

Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it*LBT*

Yeah, I meant it*LBT*

I gave up three times this week*LBT*
Went through those feelings*LBT*

No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft*LBT*

Only yesterday we were on the run*LBT*
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun*LBT*
Now I'm waiting here for someone*LBT*

And oh, love, do you feel this rough?*LBT*
Why's it only you I'm thinking of*LBT*

My shadow's dancing*LBT*
Without you for the first time*LBT*
My heart is hoping*LBT*
You'll walk right in tonight*LBT*
And tell me there are things that you regret*LBT*
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet*LBT*

Is it too much to ask?*LBT*
Is it too much to ask?*LBT*

And oh, love, watch the sun coming up*LBT*
Don't it feel fucked up we're not in love*LBT*

"Counting days, counting days since my love up and got lost on me*LBT*
And every breath that I've been taken since you left feels like a waste on me*LBT*
I've been holding on to hope that you'll come back when you can find some peace*LBT*
Cause every word that I've heard spoken since you left feels like a hollow street*LBT*

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind*LBT*
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind*LBT*
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side*LBT*

There must be something in the water*LBT*
Cause everyday it's getting colder*LBT*

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded by the brighter side*LBT*
Of what we had because it's over, well there must be something in the tide*LBT*
*LBT*
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind*LBT*
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind*LBT*
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side*LBT*
*LBT*
There must be something in the water*LBT*
Cause everyday it's getting colder*LBT*
And if only I could hold you*LBT*
You'd keep my head from going under*LBT*
*LBT*
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh*LBT*
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh*LBT*
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh*LBT*
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh*LBT*
*LBT*
It's your love I'm lost in*LBT*
Your love I'm lost in*LBT*
Your love I'm lost in*LBT*
And I'm tired of being so exhausted*LBT*
Your love I'm lost in*LBT*
Your love I'm lost in*LBT*
Your love I'm lost in*LBT*
Even though I'm nothing to you now*LBT*
Even though I'm nothing to you now*LBT*

There must be something in the water*LBT*

"Like a spotlight the water hits me*LBT*
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth*LBT*
Though I know that no one's listening*LBT*
I nervously rehearse for when you're around*LBT*
*LBT*
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind*LBT*
*LBT*
<i>[Chorus:]</i>*LBT*
Who wrote the book on goodbye?*LBT*
There's never been a way to make this easy*LBT*
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right*LBT*
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire*LBT*
*LBT*
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty*LBT*
Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head*LBT*
Though I know that our time is ending*LBT*
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed*LBT*
*LBT*
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind*LBT*
Give me one more night*LBT*

*LBT*
No one knows (knows) <i>[x2]</i>*LBT*
*LBT*
We fell from the peak*LBT*
And the stars, they broke their code*LBT*
I'm trying to forget*LBT*
How I landed on this road*LBT*
I'm caught in between*LBT*
What I wish and what I know*LBT*
When they say that you just know*LBT*
*LBT*

*LBT*
No one knows (knows) <i>[x3]</i>*LBT*

You set the other on fire <i>[x2]</i>

She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah*LBT*

"I wanna sleep next to you*LBT*

I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone*LBT*

I wanna sleep next to you*LBT*

So come over now and talk me down*LBT*
*LBT*
I wanna hold hands with you*LBT*
But that's all I wanna do right now*LBT*
And I wanna get close to you*LBT*
Cause your hands and lips still know their way around*LBT*
And I know I like to draw that line, when it starts to get too real*LBT*
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal*LBT*
*LBT*
I wanna sleep next to you*LBT*
But that's all I wanna do right now*LBT*
So come over now and talk me down*LBT*

Stuck on the bridge between us*LBT*
Gray areas and expectations*LBT*

"There was a time when I was alone*LBT*
Nowhere to go and no place to call home*LBT*
My only friend was the man in the moon*LBT*
And even sometimes he would go away too*LBT*
*LBT*
Then one night, as I closed my eyes,*LBT*
I saw a shadow flying high*LBT*
He came to me with the sweetest smile*LBT*
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile*LBT*
He said, ""Peter Pan. That's what they call me.*LBT*
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""*LBT*
And ever since that day...*LBT*
*LBT*
I am a lost boy from Neverland*LBT*
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan*LBT*
And when we're bored we play in the woods*LBT*
Always on the run from Captain Hook*LBT*
""Run, run, lost boy,"" they say to me,*LBT*
""Away from all of reality.""*LBT*
*LBT*
Neverland is home to lost boys like me*LBT*
And lost boys like me are free*LBT*
Neverland is home to lost boys like me*LBT*
And lost boys like me are free*LBT*

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe*LBT*
Believe in him and believe in me*LBT*
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green*LBT*
To your beautiful destiny*LBT*
As we soared above the town that never loved me*LBT*
I realized I finally had a family*LBT*
Soon enough we reached Neverland*LBT*
Peacefully my feet hit the sand*LBT*
And ever since that day...*LBT*

Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on*LBT*

That I don't always choose just so wisely*LBT*
But I see trees and the colored leaves*LBT*
When I think about all that we could be*LBT*
*LBT*
And when you're gone, time is so slow*LBT*
And like the grass, I've watched us grow*LBT*
I heard you reap only what you'll sow*LBT*
How could I never let you know?*LBT*
*LBT*
But you are everything to me*LBT*
You're sweeter than candy cane, better than any childhood dream*LBT*
I am yours, and you are mine*LBT*
I have your heart, I don't even need your ring*LBT*
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything*LBT*

"I met you in the dark*LBT*
You lit me up*LBT*
You made me feel as though*LBT*
I was enough*LBT*
We danced the night away*LBT*
We drank too much*LBT*
I held your hair back when*LBT*
You were throwing up*LBT*
*LBT*
Then you smiled over your shoulder*LBT*
For a minute I was stone-cold sober*LBT*
I pulled you closer to my chest*LBT*
And you asked me to stay over*LBT*
I said, I already told you*LBT*
I think that you should get some rest*LBT*
*LBT*
I knew I loved you then*LBT*
But you'd never know*LBT*
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go*LBT*
I knew I needed you*LBT*
But I never showed*LBT*
But I wanna stay with you*LBT*
Until we're grey and old*LBT*
Just say you won't let go*LBT*
Just say you won't let go*LBT*

I wake you up with some*LBT*
Breakfast in bed*LBT*
I'll bring you coffee*LBT*

Wave them goodbye*LBT*
And I'll thank my lucky stars*LBT*
For that night*LBT*

For a minute I forget that I'm older*LBT*
I wanna dance with you right now, oh*LBT*
And you look as beautiful as ever*LBT*
And I swear that every day you get better*LBT*
You make me feel this way somehow*LBT*

I'm so in love with you*LBT*

Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold*LBT*
We've come so far, my dear*LBT*

I didn't know a best friend is what I'd get*LBT*
*LBT*
Through the years I'd make mistakes*LBT*
So you wouldn't have to make 'em*LBT*
I took chances every day*LBT*
So you'd know when to take 'em*LBT*
*LBT*
You can follow my footprints*LBT*
But you don't have to fill my shoes*LBT*
It's just a path for you to follow if you so choose*LBT*
You can take the road less traveled*LBT*
Yeah, I'd probably do that too*LBT*
But if you're lost and feeling broken through and through*LBT*
You can follow the footprints I left for you*LBT*
*LBT*
I know it wasn't easy*LBT*
Learning how to share*LBT*
But now we get to share the memories*LBT*
And all the times we argued*LBT*
Swore we'd never speak again*LBT*
No tiptoe that I loved you even then*LBT*

Chasing down your dreams*LBT*
I hope that I can look ahead*LBT*

You can follow my footprints*LBT*

It's just a path for you to follow if you so choose*LBT*
You can take the road less traveled*LBT*
Yeah, I'd probably do that too*LBT*
But if you're lost and feeling broken, down and bruised*LBT*
You can follow the footprints*LBT*
I left for you*LBT*
You can follow my footprints*LBT*
I left for you

"I've been watching you for some time*LBT*
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes*LBT*
Burning cities and napalm skies*LBT*
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes*LBT*
Your ocean eyes*LBT*
*LBT*
No fair*LBT*
You really know how to make me cry*LBT*
When you give me those ocean eyes*LBT*
I'm scared*LBT*
I've never fallen from quite this high*LBT*
Falling into your ocean eyes*LBT*
Those ocean eyes*LBT*
*LBT*
I've been walking through a world gone blind*LBT*
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind*LBT*
Careful creature made friends with time*LBT*
He left her lonely with a diamond mind*LBT*
And those ocean eyes*LBT*
*LBT*
No fair*LBT*
You really know how to make me cry*LBT*
When you give me those ocean eyes*LBT*
I'm scared*LBT*
I've never fallen from quite this high*LBT*
Falling into your ocean eyes*LBT*

"Don't give up on me, 'cause I'm just in a rut*LBT*
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up*LBT*
*LBT*
Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong*LBT*
I see the mouths are open but I can't hear the song*LBT*
I've done my best to fill 'em, but the cracks are starting to spread*LBT*
Hey, I won't blame you baby, go on, turn your head*LBT*
*LBT*
But don't give up on me, 'cause I'm just in a rut*LBT*
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up*LBT*

I can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine*LBT*
The truth is on the table, and someone's gotta sign*LBT*
I've done my best defending, but the punches are starting to land*LBT*
I'm sliding into something you won't understand*LBT*

Don't give up on me, 'cause I'm just in a rut*LBT*
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up*LBT*
Don't give up on me, 'cause I'm just in a rut*LBT*

I hope you understand*LBT*
That steadily reminds you*LBT*
Of who I really am*LBT*
*LBT*
This city's always breathing*LBT*
I wish that it would die*LBT*
The kickbacks and the bachelors*LBT*
The fever for the velvet rope*LBT*
The money from my mother's men*LBT*
I'm not like her, you're not like them*LBT*
*LBT*
I'll climb and I'll climb*LBT*
I'll climb and I'll climb*LBT*

Begging for me just to give 'em a try*LBT*

"My nose is burning, too much cocaine*LBT*
Got caught in Brooklyn*LBT*
With gasoline backed up with cellophane*LBT*
I'm in need of moderation*LBT*
Nah, I need a fucking break*LBT*
'Cause I just railed down enough lines tonight*LBT*
To spell your first and last name*LBT*
I miss the ocean*LBT*
And I know it's weird to say*LBT*
I grew up then moved to LA*LBT*
It's only thirty minutes*LBT*
Four-oh-five to PCH*LBT*
But half an hour feels forever*LBT*
and a fucking day*LBT*
*LBT*
And it's all because I dreamt of you*LBT*
And woke up alone*LBT*
What a wonderful tone*LBT*
To bring you back home*LBT*
*LBT*
My soul is burning*LBT*
Need Jesus Christ*LBT*
My mom's unhappy*LBT*
With all the choices I've been making with my life*LBT*
I don't even fucking care though*LBT*
I'm probably gonna die*LBT*
Like everybody else*LBT*
Is that such a fucking lie?*LBT*
And I swear to God*LBT*
If the alcohol and drugs don't kill me*LBT*
I don't know what will*LBT*
Other than you*LBT*
*LBT*
And it's all because I dreamt of you*LBT*
And woke up alone*LBT*
And when friends hit my phone*LBT*
All they want's a repost*LBT*
It's all because I dreamt of you*LBT*
And woke up alone*LBT*
What a wonderful tone*LBT*
To bring you back home

"Oh they say people come*LBT*
Say people go*LBT*
This particular diamond was extra special*LBT*
And though you might be gone*LBT*
And the world may not know*LBT*
Still I see you celestial*LBT*
*LBT*
Like a lion you ran*LBT*
A goddess you rolled*LBT*
Like an eagle you circled*LBT*
In perfect purple*LBT*
So how come things move on*LBT*
How come cars don't slow*LBT*
When it feels like the end of my world?*LBT*
When I should but I can't let you go?*LBT*
*LBT*
But when I'm cold, cold*LBT*
When I'm cold, cold*LBT*
There's a light that you give me*LBT*
When I'm in shadow*LBT*
There's a feeling within me, an everglow*LBT*
*LBT*
Like brothers in blood*LBT*
Sisters who ride*LBT*
And we swore on that night*LBT*
We'd be friends 'til we died*LBT*
But the changing of winds*LBT*
And the way waters flow*LBT*
Life as short as the falling of snow*LBT*
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know*LBT*
*LBT*
But when I'm cold, cold*LBT*
In water rolled, salt*LBT*
And I know that you're with me*LBT*
And the way you will show*LBT*
And you're with me wherever I go*LBT*
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow*LBT*
*LBT*
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold*LBT*
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow*LBT*
*LBT*
So if you love someone, you should let them know*LBT*
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

"A warning sign*LBT*
I missed the good part, then I realised*LBT*
I started looking and the bubble burst*LBT*
I started looking for excuses *LBT*
Come on in*LBT*
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in*LBT*
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones*LBT*
That I started looking for a warning sign*LBT*

When the truth is, I miss you*LBT*
Yeah the truth is, that I miss you so*LBT*
*LBT*
A warning sign*LBT*
It came back to haunt me, and I realised*LBT*
That you were an island and I passed you by*LBT*
And you were an island to discover*LBT*

Come on in*LBT*
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in*LBT*
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones*LBT*
That I started looking for a warning sign*LBT*

Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?*LBT*

20 something, all alone still*LBT*
Not a thing in my name*LBT*

Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love*LBT*

Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings*LBT*

Weird, took us so long to separate*LBT*
I feel, it's permanent like a riptide, this time*LBT*
Waves crashing fast, I try*LBT*
Think of the past, please stay*LBT*

And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the alternative is an abyss, is just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about CTRL, and that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it*LBT*

Away from your body*LBT*
Away from your skin*LBT*

Can you tell that she's hurt?*LBT*
So sharp and alert*LBT*
She's such a clean breathe*LBT*

Starting to emerge*LBT*
I'm a ghost that I was*LBT*
A sister of her*LBT*
And I'm all the same creed*LBT*

I'll never give in*LBT*
How could I apprise you with all that she's sinned*LBT*
She feels like hell and I know 'cause I've been*LBT*
