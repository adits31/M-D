0,Charlie Cunningham,Minimum,"How do I walk this earth
So much work at first it goes
How should I walk this earth
So much worse the further, the further you go

Go take off a load
Letting your wings unfold and keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought but you're managing
That's how you evened out, out

Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between the wrong and the right
You get yours I'm gonna get mine
Is that what you signed for
They're feeding you lines to keep you on their side
It works every time

What you got to live for now you got the whole of the world at your feet?
And how much more can you pass yourself round?
What you got to live for now you got the whole of the world at your feet?
But you're still shaking
You need to make up some ground

Go take off a load
Letting your wings unfold and keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought but you're managing
That's how you evened out, out"

3,The Paper Kites,Bloom - Bonus Track,"In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness
And you fill my head with you

Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out

Can I be close to you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh

Can I take it to a morning
Where the fields are painted gold
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?

When the evening pulls the sun down
And the day is almost through
Oh, the whole world it is sleeping
But my world is you

Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)

Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)

Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh"
4,Tall Heights,Spirit Cold,"How do I wake my spirit cold?
We always say when our history's told
If only we knew the things we know
There's a question ages old

Let me down easy, let me down slow
If all good things ever come and go
Let me back down in a place I know
Hold the nail for the hammer stroke

Oh this my trash, this my tome
Oh this my blood, this my bone

How do I learn my dreams to mold,
To lay them bare in the morning cold?
If they're still out there then the chasm grows
For all you know, for all you've known

Let me down easy, let me down slow
If all good things ever come and go
Let me back down in a place I know
Hold that nail for the hammer stroke

Oh this my weapon, this my loam
Oh this my blood, this my bone

How do I wake my spirit cold?
Most people die but others just go
She's still out there and the chasm grows
Steady are the feet in the morning glow

Oh this my trash, this my tome
Oh this my weapon, this my loam
Oh this my mountain, this is my home

How do I wake my spirit cold?
There's a question ages old"

7,The Lumineers,Angela (Single Version),"When you left this town with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
Till the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

And from the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela, it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela, it's a long time coming
Oh Angela, spent your whole life running away

Home at last
Home at last

Vacancy, hotel room
Lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knees
I belong, I believe

Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last

Home at last
Mmm"
8,Vance Joy,Lay It On Me,"I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go
Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now"

10,Lord Huron,The Night We Met,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"

16,Leon Bridges,River,"Been travelling these wide roads for so long
My heart's been far from you
10, 000 Miles gone

Oh, I wanna come near and give you
Every part of me
But there is blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

In my darkness I remember
Momma's word reoccur to me:
""Surrender to the good lord
And he'll wipe your slate clean""

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Take me to your river
I wanna know

Dip me in your smooth water
I go in
As a man with many crimes
Come up for air
As my sins flow down the jordan

I wanna go wanna go wanna go
I wanna know wanna know wanna know
Wanna go wanna go wanna go
Wanna know wanna know wanna know
Wanna go wanna go wanna go
Wanna know wanna know wanna know

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Lord please let me know
Take me to your river
I wanna know"
17,Bon Iver,Holocene,"""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles

3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
The automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me “Lit Parade”
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night, it clutched the light
The hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles"

19,The Staves,Steady,"Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Oh God, oh God, oh God
God, I'm only human and I'm helpless
Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Rabbit in a snare, why you sleeping softly in your bed?
When unruly wild blood is pumping, why you running scared?
Why you running scared?
Rabbit in a snare, why you sleeping softly in your bed?
Why you running scared?
Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Oh God, oh God, oh God
God I'm only human and I'm helpless
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you see from where you're standing?)
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you hear where I'm coming from?)
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you see from where you're standing?)
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you hear where I'm coming from?)
Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Oh God, oh God, oh God
God I'm only human and I'm helpless"
20,Tall Heights,Horse to Water,"The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken
I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold
In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot
I willed the car to start to bring me home to you

Lead me back from the darkness like you do

Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview
To wish back an image of myself I thought was true
So now when colors fade and on that day of days
I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue

Oh and lead me back from the darkness like you do

Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes
Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit
I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken
Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big

But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met
You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago
There was something about you I struggled to forget
My blood was rushing down to you

You were leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse
'Cause you're a wanderer too"

22,Fleet Foxes,"If You Need To, Keep Time On Me","How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?
 
If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me
 
Who knows what State is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?
 
If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me
 
When I need to, I'll keep time on you

Wide oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes heatless fire
 
But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me
 
How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun
 
If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me"

24,Villagers,Nothing Arrived - Live from Spotify London,"Savanna scatters and the seabird sings
So why should we fear what travel brings?
What were we hoping to get out of this?
Some kind of momentary bliss?

I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived

It's our dearest ally, it's our closest friend
It's our darkest blackout, it's our final end
My dear sweet nothing, let's start anew
From here on in, it's just me and you

I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived

Well I guess it's over, I guess it's begun
It's a losers' table, but we've already won
It's a funny battle, it's a constant game
I guess I was busy, when nothing came

I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy

I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived
I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived"

27,José González,Stay Alive,"There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow 
In a world gone lean

Sometimes there's things a man cannot know
Gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
Engine won't turn
And the train won't leave

Engines won't turn and the train won't leave

I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
In the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Well the way I feel is the way I write
It isn't like the thoughts of the man who lies
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming 
Open your eyes
Look into the sun as the new days rise

And I will wait for you tonight
You're here forever and you're by my side
I've been waiting all my life
To feel your heart as it's keeping time
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Dawn is coming 
Open your eyes
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes

Look into the sun as the new days rise
There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean

But there is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming open your eyes
Look into the sun as a new days rise"
28,Of Monsters and Men,Slow And Steady,"The lights go out, I am all alone
All the trees outside are buried in the snow
I spend my night dancing with my own shadow
And it holds me and it never lets me go

I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know

My dear, old friend, take me for a spin
Two wolves in the dark, running in the wind
I'm letting go, but I've never felt better
Passing by all the monsters in my head

And I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know
And I'm never ready
'Cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me
Show what I want to show

And I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know
And I'm never ready
'Cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me
Show what I want to show"
29,Vance Joy,Georgia,"She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

Lips generous and all
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I I never understood what was at stake
Never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want a trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

And I I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out"
30,Bibio,Petals,"To see age in a flower
The dawns are speeding up
You know it'll hurt you
Feel all of a sudden
Tired and teary-eyed
You knew it'd kill you
Don't wear a tie that'll choke you
To death in the city
Take it off and forget
Spare the fret that'll make you
Miss all of summer
Sweat it out and forgive
To see loss in a shower
The petals turn to mush
It still disappoints you
Then less of a sudden
You wire your weary mind
To let it deceive you
Don't force a smile that'll make you
Resent the city
Play it soft and forgive
Keep the frown that'll make you
Squint in the summer
Play it slow and forget"
31,George Ogilvie,Foreign Hands,-1
32,The Barr Brothers,Even The Darkness Has Arms,"I was holding my breath
When the tightrope walker
Slipped into the moonglow
Saying all my children follow me
Maybe it's time to go
You can be chrome when you're wise
Can be wise when you're blue
And baby if I have, then I have for you

Bribing the jury to keep me in jail
Singing ""Tea for the Tillerman""
And although I lie fantastically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
You can be wrong when you're right
Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight, then I die for you

Calling on those that call me son
Great-grandson, or grandson
Great uncles, aunts and relatives
To judge what I have done
Gonna make right by you
Even if it's all I do
And if it's all I do, then I do for you

People will raise a whole lot of hell about
The water and the wind-mill
And although I stab chaotically
It hurts no one but me
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
Baby, I have it, and I have you too

And a light in the window
To pass the night through
May be so uncertain but what can I do
Keeping it on, keeping it on
And I know I like it but what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know
How to love you

I was breakin the law when the knight (?)
When the straw hit the whipperwill
(Missing line) oh I oh I oh I do
Hungry enough to kill
Wherever the white dove goes
It goes unseen
And he sees below
And he knows you're dreamin'

I bring to you with reverant hands
All the books that my love abides
Kind woman that my passion wore
Like the shoreline wears the tides
Maybe the water went dry
Keeping an eye on you
And with an eye on you, it could drown me too

People will raise a whole lot of hell about
The water and the wind-mill
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
Baby, I have it, and I have you too

And a light in the window
To pass the night through
May be so uncertain but what can I do
Keeping it on, keeping it on
And I know I like it but what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know
How to love you"
33,Mumford & Sons;Baaba Maal,There Will Be Time,"But in the cold light I live to love and adore you

In the cold light I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

Baaba Maal:
So I opened up my eyes
To a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night

But I lift up my eyes
To a new height
And indeed there will be time

But in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

In the cold light I live, I'll only live for you
It's all that I am

It's all that I have

And in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

In the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

Baaba Maal:
And in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have
In the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?"

I'm going through changes now
I've spent a lifetime trying to figure it out
I'm going through changes now

And I've just begun under a purple sun
There's many reasons we are what we've become
I'm going through changes, ripping out pages
I'm going through changes now

I knew it once, but I forgot
I'm going through changes now
We want everything but what we've got
I'm going through changes now

Maybe it's too soon under a purple moon
But I'd ride off with you in a big balloon
I'm going through changes, rattling cages
I'm going through changes now

Things could be different but I don't know how
I'm going through changes, through all of the strangeness
I'm going through changes now"

From the legends, a lesson, you're on
Already know your way, I am hours away

I know you want it

Oho, you're kicking out the mile
And incredible pain

If you were here, I'd find you
If you could see the ground that I am, here

Already know your way, I am hours away

I know you want it
You're singing about it

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

You stood tall the fire began to let out,
I trusted you'd refrain and keep closed your mouth

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

Words crashing through the flames smoke spreading far
And I thought we'd remain free from it's harm

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

Will we burn
Will we burn
From the fire will we learn,
To be mindful and keep away from the words that ignite the flame
Our words will ignite the flame

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
Right in front of me
Face it don't turn around, there's no running from the heat"

You're all I want, bring me the dawn

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm sinking, all my love could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I needed
I hope that I'm not too late, I hope I'm not too late

Back of the room, how come my friends already know you?
Feel like a kid, too shy to speak up so I keep it hid
Oh butterflies, you steal my sleep each night

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm sinking, all my love could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I needed
I hope I'm not too late, and I hope I'm not too late
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh

I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekends

And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else

Ooh...

So let me go

44,Iron & Wine,Call It Dreaming,"Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
Any rain softly kisses us on the face
Anywhere means we're running
We can sleep and see 'em coming
Where we drift and call it dreaming
We can weep and call it singing

Where we pray when our hearts are strong enough
We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood
Where we see enough to follow
We can hear when we are hollow
Where we keep the light we're given
We can lose and call it living

Where the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every night knows how long it's supposed to last
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine

Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray
Where our water isn't hidden
We can burn and be forgiven
Where our hands hurt from healing
We can laugh without a reason

'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every moon in our bodies make shining glass
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine"
45,Isbells,Dreamer,-1
46,Gavin James,Nervous,"I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
And we'll lose our winter coats in the spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings
'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
Scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh, I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

Oh

'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet, no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me

Oh, but I don't wanna know
But who will take you home
Who will take you home
Who will take you home
If I let you go

Oh

And now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love if you don't
No you don't
So I won't say I love you if you don't"

49,George Ezra,Barcelona,"Barcelona,
I still long to hold her once more, oh,
My boots of leather,
From Europe
I gather you know, know

Every time you have to go
Shone my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

A native man sang in a foreign tongue,
I still ache to know the song that he sung,
Barcelona

Every time you have to go
Shone my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

Every time you have to go
Shone my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

Barcelona
Barcelona

Every time you have to go
I shone my mind and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona"
50,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"
51,A Blaze of Feather,Carousel,"Sorry is a word I fail to say
Struggle with the hurt, the weight, the pace
Trouble in the darkness shifting shade
I miss her every time I try and change

I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
I can never come in the light of day
Under night memory tears me

Raising my head like a hurricane
Carousel shadows calling
Dancing

I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
(Ben Howard)
With my last breath
I comfort you

I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through"

Down that crooked road of sin
My momma locked me out again
And hung me high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

When I sing my stranger blues
I make it on the local news
Everybody likes to see you lose
And hang you high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

Little bluebird at my window
Sing a pretty song for me
Don't you know that you can fly, fly, fly away
Don't you know that you can leave

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb"
57,Benjamin Francis Leftwich,Tilikum,"I wonder what you're thinking
Staring through the rain
Going through our baby names
Your husband thinks you're sleeping
At a motorway hotel
He doesn't know tonight you're flying out of hell

Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bond lover, tonight

You're turning on your phone now
Your hands begin to shake
I'm just across the harbour bridge you say
I flew out here to tell you
I couldn't hold your pain then
Day by day I waited for your heart to melt

Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bond lover, tonight

Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bond lover, tonight"
58,Avec,Sailing Away,"I'm still sittin' here
With the only sound of the dawn
And I still wonder where
I'll be the day after all

And can you feel
The grass beneath your toes
It's like a story
Which began long time ago

And it's slowly getting cold
And I turn apart like you
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

The lights fade
Is walking next to me
My feet are stuck
In the earth underneath

And it's slowly getting cold
And I'm torn apart like you are
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go"

60,James Bay,Hold Back The River,"Tried to keep you close to me,
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But think that I should have been

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we call against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho

Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold

Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other"

62,James Vincent McMorrow,Higher Love,"Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, standing out there alone
Oh, a yearning and it's real for me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love"
63,Damien Rice,Older Chests,"Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small, and grow in time
And we all seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf
Too many books
Read me your favorite line

Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
He came back the other day
You know, some things in life may change
And some things they stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time

Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names

Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times
She broke down the other day
You know, some things in life may change
But some things they stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Time, there's always time
On my mind
Pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time"

67,Lucy Rose,Shiver,"We broke
Everything that was right
We both enjoyed a good fight

And we solved
All the holes we had to breathe
To make the other one leave

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And we stole
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
We'd never turn out to be real

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

Like I used to"

I've got to unwind

I need to find love
I've got to get high
You've got the passion
To feel inside
A little love, a little life
Now you decide
There ain't no reasons
That we can't share
A little love, a little life
Can take us there
You've got the instincts
And now you know
A little love, a little life
Will let it show
Just take a hold
Of what you feel
A little love, a little life
Will make it real
I, feel in my heart
I want to let go
And make a new start
I, have got to break free
I've got to unwind
I've got to believe"

That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me"

Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Halo halo halo halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
Halo"

7,Koda,Staying,"As winter takes me now, of cold and clammy skin
A barren empty womb, as I am born again
It's pulling at my hair, and crawling all within
A gentle beating heart is swept away by sin

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

That's enough the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

The monster in your head, won't surface again
Be still my child, wash away the sin
And I as future king, walk off the edge
Hold me by my name, hold me till the end

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love"
8,Us The Duo,Better Together,"There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, ""Why are we here?"" and ""Where do we go?""
And ""How come it's so hard?""
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of the dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me

But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"

I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene (Ooh)
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, be careful what you do (Ooh)
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (No!)
And mother always told me, be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, the lie becomes the truth (Hey)

Billie Jean is not my lover,
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
The kid is not my son,
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans (Ooh)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round,
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice (Oh, think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby cried, his eyes looked like mine, (Oh no)
'Cause we dance on the floor in the round.

People always told me, be careful what you do, (Ooh)
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (No)
She came and stood right by me, because the smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon, she called me to her room
Hey-ey!

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one,
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one,
But the kid is not my son

So, Billie Jean is not my lover, (She just a girl)
Billie Jean' is not my lover, (She just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover..."

21,Jasmine Thompson,Pompeii,"I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settles around us

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Oh where do we begin?
The rubble or our sins?
Oh where do we begin?
The rubble or our sins?

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?"

23,Sam Smith,Not In That Way,"And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

I'd never ask you cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry believe me
I love you but not in that way

And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant
I'm so dependant
I'm such a fool

When you're not there
I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear
Can't face the truth

You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

I'd never ask you
Cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry
Believe me
I love you
But not in that way

You'd say I'm sorry
Believe me
I love you
But not in that way"

Then I'll come for you
Although I'll travel far
I always hold a place for you in my heart

If you think of me
If you miss me once in a while
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart

Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

If you dream of me
Like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart

Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

Oh, I’ve longed for you
And I have desired
To see your face, your smile
To be with you wherever you are

Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting

Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me

And say you'll hold
A place for me
In your heart

A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart"
33,gnash;Olivia O'Brien,"i hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o'brien)","Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

37,Joshua Radin,Falling,"I built a place for you to land
Can you see it now
From where you stand?
You may think the fall is just too far
When you leap
You see who you really are
And if you jump now
I know you'll survive
You see it's a beautiful ride

When you're high
Flying through the sky
And on your way down
The sound of a new day
Calls you from the ground

I need to know what you mean
Would you fight for us
Or will you walk away?
All I can say is don't be afraid
It's not where you laid your head before
It's where it lay
So when I catch you I will never let go
Just don't forget I'm down below

When you're high
Flying through the sky
And on your way down
The sound of a new day
Calls you from the ground

I wanna know what you see
When you're falling
Do you think of me?
Are you the road or the end?
Either way you're my best friend
So when I catch you I'll never let you go
Just don't forget I'm down below

When you're high
Flying through the sky
And on your way down
The sound of a new day
Calls you from the ground

She's gonna be high
Flying through the sky
On her way down
The sound of a new day
Calls her from the ground

I built a place for you to land
Can you see it now?"

I need to know if we're still on
I know we've been hurting lately
You see, you came in like a thunderstorm
Electric shivers shooting through my bones
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Baby, I just wanna know
Am I still the one you think you know?
Cause you kept me anticipating
Just tell me what you need, dear
And baby, that's what I'll do
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Baby, I just wanna know
There's a ghost in my bed
The place you once rest your head
Don't fight it
Baby, I just wanna know
Just come home, this is where you belong
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Baby, are you home alone?
I need to know if we're still on
Don't fight it
I know we've been hurting lately
You see, you came in like a thunderstorm (You came in)
Electric shivers shooting through my bones (You came in)
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight"

42,Ellie Goulding,Your Song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"

I've got so much honey the bees envy me.
I've got a sweeter song than the birds from the trees.

You don't want to see
You can't seem to avoid
When you're trying to be right
On this trespassed life where
You don't seem yo care
And you're making the motions to be aware
As to why you're here

All that the countless moments
Ask of the countless thoughts
Trying to figure me out
That never seemed to come around
Till I got to that part of you
That's me

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah

I mean more now
I want more now
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven now

You're so golden
I'm so golden now

I want more now
I want more now

Looked out at the moon tonight
I can't get enough
You're hand as it starts to touch
I can't get enough

Lie down, lie down

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
You are so beautiful
Nah nah nah nah nah
You are so beautiful
Nah nah nah nah nah..."

Summertime sadness 
I just wanted you to know 
That, baby, you're the best 
I got my red dress on tonight 
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight 
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style 
High heels off, I'm feeling alive 
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air 
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare 
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere 
Nothing scares me anymore 

Nothing scares me anymore 
Kiss me hard before you go 
Summertime sadness 
I just wanted you to know 
That, baby, you're the best 
I got that summertime, summertime sadness 
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness 
Got that summertime, summertime sadness 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
I'm feelin' electric tonight 
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99 
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side 
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight 
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air 
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare 
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere 
Nothing scares me anymore 
Kiss me hard before you go 
Summertime sadness 
I just wanted you to know 
That, baby, you're the best 
I got that summertime, summertime sadness 
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness 
Got that summertime, summertime sadness 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Think I'll miss you forever 
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky 
Later's better than never 
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

3,Labrinth,Jealous,"I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me"

Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Halo halo halo halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
Halo"

7,Koda,Staying,"As winter takes me now, of cold and clammy skin
A barren empty womb, as I am born again
It's pulling at my hair, and crawling all within
A gentle beating heart is swept away by sin

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

That's enough the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

The monster in your head, won't surface again
Be still my child, wash away the sin
And I as future king, walk off the edge
Hold me by my name, hold me till the end

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love"
