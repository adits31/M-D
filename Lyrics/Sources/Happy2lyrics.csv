0,The Head and the Heart,Shake,"Well the ink in my plan went dry long before your smile
And the pages have always been blink like the trees in the wild
But the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
Time in time, I know when it's time to leave

If the memories we make, will never been lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
And time in time, I know when it's time to leave

And the memories we've made, will never be lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won't forget the one who's making you shake

Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won't forget the man who's making you shake
Who's making you shake, you shake
Ah, making you shake
You shake
Ah, making you shake"
1,Milo Greene,1957,"Your house that sits behind me 
Is covered in ivy green 
The windows that we watch from 
Are old and chipping at the beam 

It takes me away 
Takes me away 
Takes me away 

The scent you wear moves in lines 
From your apartment into mine 
You act like you don't know me 
My god, you tempt my anxious mind 

It takes me away 
Takes me away 
Takes me away 

Would it be much better if I knew nothing about you 
Would it be much better if I knew nothing about you 

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I... 
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I... 

It takes me away 
Takes me away 
Takes me away"

3,Half Moon Run,Call Me In The Afternoon,"You can have it if you don't mind some or all the others stay with me
You confuse me with your riddles and your sudden generosity

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

You can have it when you come by, you can have yourself a one-man way
I saw you when it caught your eye and it's such a petty price to pay

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't be out this late
Really wanna make you feel home
Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't get this fucked up
Really wanna get it to you

Slide another shot by and wipe your dirty hands on me
Swallow till you go blind and find a little company

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

After all, when I listen, it could be you, could be anyone that I want"
4,Houndmouth,Sedona,"The red sandstone, it fell
Right smack on top of Sedona Arabella
When John Ford said, ""Won't you hop on in
To the stage coach baby gonna take you for a spin, oh oh.""

Hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink
A Saturday night kinda pink

The blacklist and it's hosts
Came down so swift and it drove 'em to the coast
We're goin' California but we're all out of work
I guess that's better than a grave and a hearse oh oh

Hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink
A Saturday night kinda pink

The devil's in a rush
And his duct tape makes you hush
Hey there Sedona let me cut you a deal
I'm a little hung over and I may have to steal your soul, oh oh

Hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink
So bright and pink
A Saturday night kinda pink"

8,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord
Were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits
So I'll play my part

I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom and a place for the end

I won't be late for this, late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time, ah"
9,Vance Joy,Lay It On Me,"I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go
Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now"

11,Of Monsters and Men,King And Lionheart,"Takin' over this town, they should worry
But these problems aside I think I taught you well
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run

And in the winter night sky, ships are sailin'
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

A lionheart

His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wonderin' eyes of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And as the world comes to an end
I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart

A lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart
A lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

A lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart
A lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart, a lionheart"
12,Hozier,Someone New,"Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sent
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day

Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new"
13,The Revivalists,Wish I Knew You,"You shine like a star
You know who you are
You're everything beautiful

She's hot, hot like the sun
The loneliest one
Still everything beautiful

Well, I'll be goddamned
You're standing at my door
We stayed up in the city

They got you, got you, got you on the run?

14,First Aid Kit,Wolf,"Wolf mother, where you been?
You look so worn, so thin
You're a taker, devil's maker
Let me hear you sing, hey ya, hey ya

Wolf father at the door
You don't smile anymore
You're a drifter, shape-shifter
Let me see you run, hey ya, hey ya

Holy light, oh, burn the night
Oh, keep the spirits strong
Watch it grow, child of wolf
Keep holding on

When I run through the deep
Dark forest long after this begun
Where the sun would set
Trees were dead and the rivers were none

And I hope for a trace
To lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound
There was only me and my disgrace

Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, ya

Wolf mother, where you been?
You look so worn, so thin
You're a taker, devil's maker
Let me hear you say, hey ya, hey ya

Wolf father at the door
You don't smile anymore
You're a drifter, shape-shifter
Let me see you run, hey ya, hey ya

Wayward winds
The voice that sings of a forgotten land
See it fall, child of wolf
Lend a mending hand

When I run through the deep dark forest
Long after this begun
Where the sun would set
Trees were dead and the rivers were none

And I hope for a trace
To lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound
There was only me and my disgrace

Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, ya"

Go and raise your head up high

Our bodies they will collide
Our bodies they will collide
Our bodies they will collide

My father told me now go ahead
Be the best man you ever had
I would have raised you if I could
Be the best man I knew you would

Our bodies they will collide
Our bodies they will collide
Our bodies they will collide
Our bodies they will collide

But there are 10 million reasons why I would be around
I'm grateful for the days you had me runnin' wild
Lookin' back I'm sure you would have changed things somehow
And now its up to me to go as far as I can

Oh I will try

25,The Tallest Man On Earth,King of Spain,"I never knew I was a lover,
Just 'cause I steal the things you hide,
Just 'cause I focus while we're dancing,
Just 'cause I offered you a ride.

Still I am not from Barcelona,
I am not even from Madrid.
I am a native of the North Pole
And that can mess up any kid.

Well if you could reinvent my name,
Well if you could redirect my day,
I wanna be the King of Spain.

And I will settle in Pamplona
And I'll provoke the bulls with words
And then I'll send a man to meet them all
But he's fake, so I have heard.

And all the senoritas sighing,
Will be the fountain of my lies.
But while we're floating in siestas
You search for bottles and for knives.

Well if you could reinvent my name,
Well if you could redirect my day,
I wanna be the King of Spain.

And I wear my boots of Spanish leather
Oh while I'm tightening my crown.
I'll disappear in some flamenco
Perhaps I'll reach the other side.

Why are you stabbing my illusion?
Just 'cause I stole some eagle's wings
Because you named me as your lover
Well, I thought I could be anything.

Well if you could reinvent my name,
Well if you could redirect my day,
I wanna be the King of Spain."

O' be joyful
Is that what you're brewing
Does your daddy know
That's what you're doing
His little girl's got a reputation out for ruin
She was givin' them the country away

Machete in the tree stub, hound dog on the chain
Wooden-legged woman playin' a banjo in the rain.
Can't recall the tune but the song's always the same
""Jesus give me strength""

But babe, it's all right
I'm gonna wrap you up tonight,
Carry you out right on time

Well she got Comanche, she got Iroquois
She got a young man that she plays with like a toy
He don't mind when she call him little boy
That's a thing that he enjoys

She wants to give it all back but it's a little too late
He want to start all over, want a shiny clean slate.
Just skin him like a snake and hang him up over the gate.
Don't believe it? Just you wait

But babe, it's all right
I'm gonna wrap you up tonight,
Carry you out right on time

Hey, all right.

I beat myself up
I'm trying to trust you
And never give up

Oh I know
You gotta be wrong
Sometimes
If you wanna get along
Don't you know that

And don't you happiness is not a place
It's the road you take
And who you choose to walk it with
And the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's okay
But I wish it was easy like it sounds
Just believe one day
And your walls start coming down
Trust me things are gonna be alright

You're never gonna be sure no
At some point you jump
And sometimes it works out
And sometimes it don't
'Cause I feel fine
I feel fucked up
One day it's alright it's all good baby
And then it's not

Oh I know
You gotta be wrong
Sometimes
If you wanna get along
Don't you know that

And don't you happiness is not a place
It's the road you take
And who you choose to walk it with
And the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's okay
But I wish it was easy like it sounds
Just believe one day
And your walls start coming down
Trust me things are gonna be alright"

Where we pray when our hearts are strong enough
We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood
Where we see enough to follow
We can hear when we are hollow
Where we keep the light we're given
We can lose and call it living

Where the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every night knows how long it's supposed to last
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine

Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray
Where our water isn't hidden
We can burn and be forgiven
Where our hands hurt from healing
We can laugh without a reason

'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every moon in our bodies make shining glass
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine"

36,Of Monsters and Men,Dirty Paws,"Jumpin' up and down the floor
My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talkin' trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

So, for a while things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws"

You used to catch me in your bed-sheets and a-rattling your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

You used to bite, I used to moan
But now I'm mumbling and you choke
Well I ain't so scary on my own
Tell me honey, what's a dagger without a cloak?

'Cause
You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed-sheets and a-rattling your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

In the midnight hours, you came alive
I had to go get my crystal ball
Gotta find that snake
When the sun came up we got no place to hide
And you had to tell your friends that my fangs where fake
I just had to.

You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed-sheets there's a-rattling in your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

But even when one is
Dead and gone
It still take two to make a house home
I'm as lonesome as the catacombs
I hear you call me name but no one's there
Except a feelin' in the air
(Ooh)

You and I both know that the house is haunted
Yeah you and I both know that the ghost is you
You used to walk around screaming, all slamming all 'dem doors.
Well I'm all grown up now and I don't scare easy no more

Yeah, You and I both know
Ooh
You and I both know
Ooh
Yeah you and I both know

And I gave my eyes to the boredom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in

And he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh I said I'd been away, and he knew...
Oh he knew the depths I was meanin'
And it felt so good to see his face
All the comfort invested in my soul
Oh to feel the warmth, of his smile

No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows outta nowhere on a candle of the wild
Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
'Cause, Lord, she found me just in time

'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me, call me ""baby""
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care

We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God, it wasn't for us

She's gonna save me, call me ""baby""
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care

We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the green at night, let my mind reset
Looking up from the cigarette and she's already left
I start picking up the art for what's left of me and our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me, call me ""baby""
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care

We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride round picking up clues

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
At playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side-by-side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

When silly thoughts go through my head
'Bout the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet

They may call it a shot in the dark
From what we know, it's not unheard of

And we'll one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

Our favorite parts are what we'll keep
Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories
So everything else has room to grow
'Cause in better light, everything changes

So we can one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race there's only a runner
1, 2, 3 even when you get tired
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race, no ending in sight
No second too short, no window too tight

Just turn off the lights when you leave
'Cause we've got everything we're gonna need
We're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run child
We gotta run, we gotta run, we gotta run child

Six years ago
Felt the shadow strangle home
And the worry, oh no the phone
I hear the mourning, please come home
 
Within my own regret, my spirit go
Leaves the fires, the final blow
Get in conflict, I do recall
From the darkness calling for
 
I'll call for you
Choking on the white noise rushing
Howling from the great beyond
I'll call for you
I recall the fires raining down
 
There was yearing, stone cold
With the seaming waves of war
And the name breaks, haunting on
I lost key of all that ever were

Some as strong men, some sick may call
Seen the judge before your own
Then you worry, your ways are mourning
Found my heart in those who gave you warmth
 
I'll call for you
Choking on the white noise rushing
Howling from the great blue
I'll call for you
I recall the fires raining down

74,Ten Fé,Elodie,"Elodie it's been a while
Giving up on love, that's not my style
Tender notes in a harder key
Singing the lines that weren't meant for me
No, I never wanted to go away
And with a heavy heart I come back to say
I'm another man, I'm another one
The feeling has gone, I know I'm no longer the one

(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I don't know if I can, hold on
(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
Though I hold you again, I know I'm no longer that one

I realize what I'm throwing away
On a summer night I still hear you say
Standing there with your red coat on
""Where does a lover go when a love's undone?""
Well he went away and he'll go again
I can promise you all that you like when I hold your hand
Well I can't lie when I say I don't wait
No, so quit holding on, you know I'm no longer the one

(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I don't know if I can, hold on
(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I can hold you again, but I know I'm no longer that one

Out of that night, knock on your door
The light on your face, up and into your room
Put on that light, come out of that shade
Don't need to know why, the bed unmade

(I wanted to stay the same)
And I'm turning away, I'm running down those stairs
(You promised you wouldn't change)
And I'm out of your door, moving out of your place
(Didn't want it to end this way)
Moving into that night, I'm going away
(Didn't want it to end this way)
I wanted to say, I just wanted to say

(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I don't know if I can, hold on
(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
Though I hold you again, I know I'm no longer that one
(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I don't know if I can, hold on
(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I can hold you again, but I know I'm no longer that one"

Out of body, out of mind

Done with my perfect lies
And I I I am done with the perfect
Done with the perfect bride

Fizzing through my blood, trying to fight it down
Paralyzed and lidded I am mumbling the sounds

Buzzing in my body trying to wrestle for control

78,James Vincent McMorrow,Sparrow and the Wolf,"Sparrow and wolf lay as still as the blades of the grass
Like worn leather boots, of color and size that would last
Caught them a lark in a trap and each held a wing
Then they tore it apart, before that small bird could sing

Confused by the wind, bruised by the size of the rain
She turned in to him, begged for the light to remain
But plans have been made, all the furniture sold
So store up your hate, use it for warmth when you're cold

For I have seen no joy, only danger
I see no joy, only strangers
I see no joy, see no joy in this world
Should you choose to go, please be careful of
Lonesome roads, men who travel them will not know
Will not know of your ways

Still I have seen no joy, only dangers
I see no joy, only strangers
I see no joy, see no joy in this world
You should choose to go
Please remember what you have learned from the little bird
Always dear, always dear to my heart"

And I said, ""thank you for your thoughts, but I'm done.""
I said that I would never build this up right here
And he said, ""that's why I can't work with you son.""

But I can't let this go I'm on my way
You can only hold my diamond ring
But I'll go crawling back to the city I love
'Cause it's already taken everything

I'm going to Coney Island have myself a dog
And reminisce why I still hate it here
It's all these people with their cotton candy eyes
It's so sweet, now put the train in gear

But I can't let this go I'm on my way
You can only hold my diamond ring
But I'll go crawling back to the city I love
'Cause it's already taken everything

The ground is swallowing my options full release
And if it rains they might just disappear
I counted 27 birds up there today
I'm thinking that's why I still love it here
I'm thinking that's why I still love it here

But I can't let this go I'm on my way
You can only hold my diamond ring
But I'll go crawling back to the city I love
'Cause it's already taken everything

Something so precious about this

Silence all of the noise that I can do without

Tears that set you free
You're the sweetest thing that I ever did see

Like the shadows that dance up on the silver screen
And years from now, when I look back
I'm still under your spell somehow

You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher

You and me been catching on like wildfire

Don't get up just to get another
You can drink from mine
We can't leave each other

We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you
Want to get older with me

Well get over it kid, you don't want any part in it

But it's not the way you can't afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

Is this it
This is it

So they paid you to scream
But it buried your dreams
So you wait for the pain that will send you to sleep again

Now you walk with your wolves
Like you got nothing to lose
Act like you don't care while you pray for a cross to bear

But it's not the way you can't afford your time

So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I had caused with my two hands
Alone we traveled
Armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

We sleep until the sun goes down
We sleep until the sun goes down

We sleep until the sun goes down

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down

You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"
