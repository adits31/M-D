3,Labrinth,Jealous,"I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me"

5,Lotte Kestner,Halo,"Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Halo halo halo halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
Halo"

7,Koda,Staying,"As winter takes me now, of cold and clammy skin
A barren empty womb, as I am born again
It's pulling at my hair, and crawling all within
A gentle beating heart is swept away by sin

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

That's enough the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

The monster in your head, won't surface again
Be still my child, wash away the sin
And I as future king, walk off the edge
Hold me by my name, hold me till the end

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love"
8,Us The Duo,Better Together,"There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, ""Why are we here?"" and ""Where do we go?""
And ""How come it's so hard?""
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of the dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me

But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"

19,The Civil Wars,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene (Ooh)
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, be careful what you do (Ooh)
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (No!)
And mother always told me, be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, the lie becomes the truth (Hey)

Billie Jean is not my lover,
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
The kid is not my son,
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans (Ooh)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round,
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice (Oh, think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby cried, his eyes looked like mine, (Oh no)
'Cause we dance on the floor in the round.

People always told me, be careful what you do, (Ooh)
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (No)
She came and stood right by me, because the smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon, she called me to her room
Hey-ey!

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one,
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one,
But the kid is not my son

So, Billie Jean is not my lover, (She just a girl)
Billie Jean' is not my lover, (She just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover..."

21,Jasmine Thompson,Pompeii,"I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settles around us

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Oh where do we begin?
The rubble or our sins?
Oh where do we begin?
The rubble or our sins?

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?"

23,Sam Smith,Not In That Way,"And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

I'd never ask you cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry believe me
I love you but not in that way

And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant
I'm so dependant
I'm such a fool

When you're not there
I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear
Can't face the truth

You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

I'd never ask you
Cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry
Believe me
I love you
But not in that way

You'd say I'm sorry
Believe me
I love you
But not in that way"

Then I'll come for you
Although I'll travel far
I always hold a place for you in my heart

If you think of me
If you miss me once in a while
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart

Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

If you dream of me
Like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart

Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

Oh, I’ve longed for you
And I have desired
To see your face, your smile
To be with you wherever you are

Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting

Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me

And say you'll hold
A place for me
In your heart

A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart"
33,gnash;Olivia O'Brien,"i hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o'brien)","Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

37,Joshua Radin,Falling,"I built a place for you to land
Can you see it now
From where you stand?
You may think the fall is just too far
When you leap
You see who you really are
And if you jump now
I know you'll survive
You see it's a beautiful ride

When you're high
Flying through the sky
And on your way down
The sound of a new day
Calls you from the ground

I need to know what you mean
Would you fight for us
Or will you walk away?
All I can say is don't be afraid
It's not where you laid your head before
It's where it lay
So when I catch you I will never let go
Just don't forget I'm down below

When you're high
Flying through the sky
And on your way down
The sound of a new day
Calls you from the ground

I wanna know what you see
When you're falling
Do you think of me?
Are you the road or the end?
Either way you're my best friend
So when I catch you I'll never let you go
Just don't forget I'm down below

When you're high
Flying through the sky
And on your way down
The sound of a new day
Calls you from the ground

She's gonna be high
Flying through the sky
On her way down
The sound of a new day
Calls her from the ground

I built a place for you to land
Can you see it now?"

39,Anna Of The North,Baby,"Baby, are you home alone?
I need to know if we're still on
I know we've been hurting lately
You see, you came in like a thunderstorm
Electric shivers shooting through my bones
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Baby, I just wanna know
Am I still the one you think you know?
Cause you kept me anticipating
Just tell me what you need, dear
And baby, that's what I'll do
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Baby, I just wanna know
There's a ghost in my bed
The place you once rest your head
Don't fight it
Baby, I just wanna know
Just come home, this is where you belong
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Baby, are you home alone?
I need to know if we're still on
Don't fight it
I know we've been hurting lately
You see, you came in like a thunderstorm (You came in)
Electric shivers shooting through my bones (You came in)
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight"

I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"

Talkin' 'bout my girl
My Girl

I've got so much honey the bees envy me.
I've got a sweeter song than the birds from the trees.
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

You can't seem to avoid
When you're trying to be right
On this trespassed life where
You don't seem yo care
And you're making the motions to be aware
As to why you're here

All that the countless moments
Ask of the countless thoughts
Trying to figure me out
That never seemed to come around
Till I got to that part of you
That's me

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah

I mean more now
I want more now
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven now

You're so golden
I'm so golden now

I want more now
I want more now

Looked out at the moon tonight
I can't get enough
You're hand as it starts to touch
I can't get enough

Lie down, lie down

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
You are so beautiful
Nah nah nah nah nah
You are so beautiful
Nah nah nah nah nah..."

Done my hair up real big beauty queen style 
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
