The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing all right
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

Now, I can't say I'll be all right without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Heres what I'll do

I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you"

14,Khalid,Coaster,"As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the holes
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me"

I want this too
I want in you

Time is being wasted screaming
Not listen I promise you'll heal me better
You're so unaware about the feeling
The same thing, the same damn thing

Time is standing still
And why are we still here
I don't wanna fight you
I'm needing the same as you

20,Eli Sostre,Let You Go,"You're just tryna figure where I'm at
I'ma always tell you what I lack love
Fuck with me, I'm only talkin' facts
I've been drinkin' lately, I might act up
Jewelry on, I used to rock my brother chains
I was broke, they wanted me to stay the same
Fuck it bet, she bust it open for some change
Brought the family with me, feelin' like the Waynes
Get the fuck up out my face with all these questions
Did it on my own so I don't need suggestions
Hit the road, it'd been a minute since I checked in
Now you miss me, I just hope you're out there reppin'
Pretty bitch, she keep my picture on the wall, yeah
If you love me, hope you love me and my flaws, yeah
I wouldn't trade this feelin' for the world
Only right, I throwed some diamonds on my girl
Yeah, yeah
 
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go, oh oh oh
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go, oh oh oh

Tell me what you heard about
Tell me all the stories that you heard about
Say I'm fuckin' around, but that's just word to mouth
Used to want forever, you ain't sure now
Yeah, let's get connected, get connected
Yeah, them niggas talkin' down, yeah, they're talkin' reckless
Homie, I would hate it too lookin' at my neckless
Every time they hit my town, they're gon' need protection
Baby, back to you
Cell phone keep ringin' out the new
I got drugs in my bag, that's for you
If you tell a story on me tell the truth
Oh, yeah
 
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go, oh oh oh
You're always on my mind
I still try to find some time
But you make it so hard to let you go"

Ain't the first to fall
To notice you can't have it all

I ain't a cold hearted man, won't give you false hopes
But I ain't made of stone
Got limits, I'll get weak if you get too close

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own

You got me faded, stuck in a daze
Trying to keep up with your pace but I'm growing old
Guess I'm getting tired

And I've been meaning to tell you, what's been on my mind
I'm just scared you'll leave, been left alone too many times

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own"

No more
I just wanna see you up and out
Out of the door

I don't wanna be your girl no more

Why are we wasting all of this time now?
Let me be clear baby
You won't be stressing me in my prime now
You need to speak to me better
Talk to me like I'm worth a damn
You could be treating me better
And I could be doing well on my on now, now, now
You say baby

""Hold me tight
Don't let go
Ease my mind
Keep me close
Hold me tight""

You're so subjective
This don't reflect what you give me

(Oh)
You're so subjective

If this is love
I don't want it
I don't need it
I could live without it

Oh I thought that I was okay
(Ain't I) treat you all the best ways?
(Ain't I) there whenever you call?
(Ain't I) check my tone when we don't agree
And I watch my words like a hawk?
(Ain't I) make it right when I'm wrong?
(Ain't I) stay away from whatcha' don't like?
(Ain't I?)
It's super fake that you can't relate

You need to speak to me better
Trying to hide the truth
You've got all these expectations but they don't apply to you
I'm not here for it
I don't wan't that for myself
I could be doing well on my own now, now, now
You say baby

""Hold me tight
Don't let go
Ease my mind
Keep me close
Hold me tight""

I should've heard your fear
So, it's on me, so, it's on
I should've heard your needs
So, it's on, so, it's on, so, it's on

We've thrown apart these pieces
We've thrown apart these pieces
So, I don't go home
Tell me love, tell me love

You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
You're my

Instead of something to break apart
Instead, it's just broke apart
Stand up and shake this heart
Instead, it's just a break apart from us

I should've heard your fear
Shame on me
I should've heard your needs
Shame on me

Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out"

That all things must change and remain
Like I know you do, oh
People come and go
There is something you should know
Please don't explain
It's the same refrain
Yes it might be strange
Love can get changed
You make my thoughts come alive
Now I'm here to stay
Not to play these games
Nothing is for sure
I'd rather let you go
All things must change and remain

58,Kenny Wayne Shepherd,True Lies,"Where do you go after midnight
When all the doors should be closed
Your alibis just don't sound right
I asked but nobody knows
How can you look in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With those True Lies

Someone's been sleepin' in my bed
This room don't smell like you and me
Who's that been sneakin' out the window
Do you think I'm too blind to see
When you look me in the eyes
And, make it sound so very nice
With those True Lies
It was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your True Lies

You been doin' this so long now
You're thinkin' it's the truth
I guess it don't seem so wrong if it
Ain't bein' done to you
Gotta lot to learn, baby,
You can keep it down
Word gets in the wind
Then it's bound to blow back around

Girl, can you give me a reason
Bet you don't even know why
Can't figure out what you're thinkin'
Or what it is you're tryin' to justify
When you look me in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With your True Lies
It was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your True Lies
You can laugh, you can cry
But, girl, I just can't buy
Those True Lies"

I'm gonna hug you and kiss you girl until the break of day
Ooie baby - You give me chills and a thrill that I can't explain - can't explain
I've been missing you so bad baby, your tender huggin and your lovins gonna drive me insane

When you touch me you send chills all down my spine
You make a blind man see, girl you make a strong man cry

When you can't find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
And you feel like you've lost you're way
When the candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say

He used to say soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Well now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day

I grew up thinkin' that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
But life can take the strongest man
And make him feel so alone
Now sometimes I feel a cold wind
Blowin' through my achin' bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said 'Boy, in the darkness before the dawn'

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, you feel like this (yes you can)
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Lord now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Yeah, shine on and on and on

Oh, it's better than sunshine

Yeah I'm good... you still working?
Tonight, right now? Did I go out? Yeah I went out.
I went... I went to a couple of clubs.
I never went to bed, shit... wine or water?
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that imma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry.""

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said ""You niggas crazy.""
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble"
126,NAV;Metro Boomin,Held Me Down,-1
127,Drake,Look What You've Done,"It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father -- my one button, you push it
Now it's ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son -- man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked from me to you, got from me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it

(Drake's Grandmother)
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help
In keeping me in this, in this comfortably
All I can say Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feelings about that
So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you..."
128,A Boogie Wit da Hoodie,Still Think About You,"Now I'm saying what's good with you
I remember being in the hall with you
I still think about you

Fuck all the phony shit

I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe Shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened my mom always told me this
I was only thirteen when she told me this:
""Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing

But I'm going up though I just hope I don't lose it
Bitches picking and choosing
But I know wassup tho
I already been through it
We could've been balling together
Hit up the mall its whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever

Yeah yeah
Do re mi fa so

Yeah
If I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound of breaking glass on my range rover
Pay me back or bitch it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'mma stay asleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya'
It go like

Do re mi fa so fucking done with you girl
So fucking done with all the games you play
I ain't no tic tac toe
Send the X and Os on another note I'm ghost
Do re mi fa so fucking done with you baby
So send the X and Os on another note I'm ghost

If I could go back to that day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up everyday and make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments, your makeup bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
Cause everybody wanted to tap that ass sometime

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya'
It go like

133,PARTYNEXTDOOR;Drake,Come and See Me (feat. Drake),"Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are getting intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me
Telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking
Like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
134,Post Malone,I Fall Apart,"Ooh I fall apart
Ooh yeah...

She told me that I'm not enough, yeah
And she left me with a broken heart, yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault, yeah
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain, yeah
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's novacane, yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
Hard as damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it
No you said it
No you said it
We'd be together

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
Hard as damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

I don't wanna drink the Sprite unless it's dirty

Listen to my music and she think she know me
When I'm on the drugs, baby that's the real me, yeah
Your boyfriend say he can't stand me
'Cause every time you fuck you always creepin' on me
Like I work for Best Buy, got them tablets
Got the Addys and the mollies and the perkys on me
Fuck your man, he ain't got nothin' on me
She say, ""You ain't got respect, you always nuttin' on me""
Girl you shouldn't have come out here with me
If they pull me over they gon' find somethin' on me

Said she scared to pop a pill
Girl you know what's the deal when you're hangin' with me
We ain't gotta go nowhere
Open up my lil' box, I brought the party with me
And I always drive impaired
Always fuck bitches in pairs, I wanna fuck a bitch in Paris
Remember when they didn't care?
Now when they see me, bitches stare
I'm throwin' Xannys in the air
If she catch one in her mouth she gon' be sleepin' on me
Ain't talkin' Gucci when I say I got them double G's on me
Look me in my eyes and pop another one with me
She try to challenge me, she overdosin' fuckin' 'round with me

Said she scared to pop a pill
Girl you know what's the deal when you're hangin' with me
Tryna see if you for real

136,Drake,Do Not Disturb,"Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep till morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

So where you at right now...

He got nothing to say
He just wanna fuck around
He just stuck in his ways
Hes no different from these niggas
They all one in the same
And every time he fucks you over
You're the one that he blames
Look
To be honest girl
You better off alone
Always worried bout who sending
Them messages to his phone
You don't need him baby
You deserve better
You should've known
You was better off on your own
But these things take time
Girl he wasn't loyal
He was fucking with your mind
Not saying I'm better
But that won't happen if you're mine
Baby not ever
He did you wrong so many times
You looking for something
You ain't never gonna find
'Cause you way to good
For a nigga not to give you
What you need
You deserve better
You need someone like me (like me)
No telling what that might be...

I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee
He ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell
You ain't happy where you at right now
Way to good to take him back right now
So where you at right now

I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy
Where you at right now
You way to good
To take him back right now
So where you at right now...
So where you at right now...
So where you at right now...
I can tell you ain't happy
Where you at right now
You way to good
To take him back right now
So where you at right now...

I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee
He ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell
You ain't happy where you at right now
Way to good to take him back right now
So where you at right now"
146,gnash;Olivia O'Brien,"i hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o'brien)","Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"
147,Frank Ocean,Solo (Reprise),"Aye, aye, so now I'm

So-lo that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So-lo that I don't get high no more
When I ""Geronimo!"", I just go eh
So-lo my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So-lo that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So-lo that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole that once was a logo, how fitting
So-lo that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling this only worsens
So-lo my halo, stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So-lo that when they throw pussy or pesos
I don't pay no attention to it
So-lo that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After 20 years in, I'm so naive
I was under the impression
That everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and yeah that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?"

This is not the place for all this

I've been feeling kinda down myself
I've been going through it as well
Girl, I guess time will tell
That's the problem, I ain't got any left
There's somethings I can't help

I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh

Lost in the pessimistic state of perception
It's been hard to participate in natural instances
And due to my history, I don't know what's next for me
But keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse

Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift to a place, where the devil lives
My soul rise to the sky, made of abyss
With the evidence, that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now
We tearing it down, we make these incredible sounds
We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

Oh, you can't run away
From everything you made
You try to erase
Memories will fade"
150,Drake,30 for 30 Freestyle,"Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?

Did this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Verse 1: Drake)
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out""

Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life, I guess."" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Now I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk

Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gon' raise a kid by ourself?

Handle biz by ourself

Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world

When I ain't got shit to give 'em
And I'm not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out
Girl, you gotta think 'bout how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it

Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals

It figures though, should've known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them draws?
Knowing all the right things to say

I let you hit it raw mothafucker
Now I'm pregnant you don't wanna get involved muthafucker
Tryna take away a life, is you God mothafucker?
I don't think so

This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife
This new life here imma love it
I'm ain't budging, I'll do this by my muthafucking self

See my momma raised me without no muthafucking help from a man
But I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back?
Bout your father and you told me that you hate nigga

Talkin' 'bout he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mamma when she had you and he ain't shit
Here you go doin' the same shit
You ain't shit nigga!

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And ain't nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it

Now, I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And ain't nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it

They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons
They grow apart she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her

Now she wide open
She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though

Uh oh, she tellin' him she missed her period like typos
He panicking, froze up like a manikin
A life grows inside her now he asking ""Is it even mine?""
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dawg?

Could she be lying?
She crying, crying 'cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas' emotions like they some action figures

Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It's like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?
(What about your seed nigga?)

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it"
164,Drake,Doing It Wrong,"When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

(Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica)"
165,Drake,Redemption,"Yeah, I get it
I get it
Yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah

Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know"
166,Frank Ocean,Thinkin Bout You,"A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)
How you feel (how you feel)
And though you were my first time
A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not if my spirit keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Till it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo"
167,Khalid,Saved,"1, 2, 3, 4

The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing all right
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

Now, I can't say I'll be all right without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Heres what I'll do

I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you"

And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
'C' on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level I am the I am (whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride
Ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""issa knife""
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by they selves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards
I made my baby buy
Amazing the cash online unknown
I made my baby buy
Blazing the dash counting money at home

In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers

Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there

At Warwick every Wednesday
Can't control you
Partyin' with rappers
Actin' hoeish too
You got yourself a singer, ah

When it was on, we was on fire
Even let you and your girls go whip the Ghost 'round town
Draped you head to toe in Gucci Ghost, wow
And I never got a single fuckin' thank you from you
Or, ""I love you daddy""
You ungrateful bitch
The more the baddie, more the bratty
Man, I'd take you out for dinners
Take you shopping for them clothes
Before I got so distant
And you got so fucking cold

I miss the old you
I miss the old you
I used to hold you
I used to hold you
And that ain't cost nothing, baby
Real love don't cost a motherfuckin' penny
I miss the old me
I miss the way I used to be

And now these drugs controllin' me
It's all your fault, baby
Still reaching for the Henny

And I never got a single fuckin' thank you from you

I miss the old you
Before you fucked G-Eazy
Both the Migos too
Started bumping 21
And now just 'cause we do
On the slow notes, late night
Beartrap, mansionz
I got snoozegod on my right
I pour a 4 up in my Sprite

Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

This is the 6's year

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
183,Khalid,Angels,"I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

They'll hold onto their secrets
And tone our memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ay

I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin'
Nobody's talkin' 'cause talkin' just turns into screamin'
Oh

And now as I'm yellin' over her, she's yellin' over me
All that that means
Is neither of us are listening
(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember why we're fighting.

So both of us are mad for...

Nothin' (fighting for)
Nothin' (crying for)
Nothin' (whoa)
But we won't let it go for nothin'

(No not for)

No, I don't wanna go to bed

And it gets me upset, girl
When you're constantly accusing.

We're fighting this war, baby
When both of us are losing.
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)

Whoa...
(What happened to workin' it out?)
We've fall into this place
Where you ain't backin' down and I ain't backin' down
So what the hell do we do now...

It's all for...

Nothin' (fighting for)
Nothin' (crying for)
Nothin' (whoa)
But we won't let it go for

Nothin'...

Oh no no no...

Oh, baby this love ain't gonna be perfect
(Perfect, perfect, oh oh)
And just how good it's gonna be
We can fuss and we can fight,
Long as everything's all right between us...
Before we go to sleep.

Baby, we're gonna be happy.

Baby, I know sometimes it's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain

Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh

When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

Frank Ocean and Raoul Duke:
Got on my buttercream silk shirt
And it's Versace
(One of God's original prototype)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught, oh?

She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be
Whipping meals up for a family of her own someday

Nothing wrong
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong with a lie
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all

Lost in the thrill of it all

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
I'm not in love, I won't let you control what I want
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love

Hey you, you, no, you, you, you

202,Eminem,When I'm Gone,"Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back"

Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder

About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass.
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last...

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship

All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner

Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim

We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
'Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state

Can't see her play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""That ain't true.""

All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in

Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe

And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies"

So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love"
218,Drake,Over My Dead Body,"How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself ""why do you worry?""
You know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

(Drake - Verse 1)
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

(Drake - Verse 2)
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
'Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together -- I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got 10 years to go huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right"

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back

It feels so different being here

Life for me is not the same
There's no one to turn to
I don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not to blame at all
Remember when I pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere
Girl I should've been right there

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Girl I'm losin' my mind
Yes I made a mistake
I thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me
I miss you so bad I can't sleep
I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me
But this can't be happening

I just had a wake up call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not blame at all
Remember when I pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere
Girl I should've been right there

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?

How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?

You ain't just tryna be friends
Tryna give me the world when I'm on another planet
I don't understand it, I don't understand it
Ask me for the feedback, I give it like Janet

Yeah you can't make me love you
Love you, love you
You can't make me love you If I don't
You can't make me love you if I won't
Yeah, you can't change my heart, you're tryin' too hard
You can't make me love you no I won't, I won't"
233,Khalid,Hopeless,"Spend my time worrying about broken promises
Focused on the smell of your burned out cigarette
My thoughts play on repeat, only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be something you'll forget
Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Uuuh, I'm blown blown blown

Now, tell me was I ever something that you could've grant?
I know I wasn't the one for you, but at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like why do we two part ways?
But if my memory's vibe, you're the one that left
I feel hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Uuuh, I'm blown blown blown

Used to lift me higher, but I guess our time is by us
I'm giving you the match,
Set our love on fire
Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Uuuh, I'm blown blown blown

Now, tell me was I ever something that you could've grant?
I know I wasn't the one for you, but at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like why do we two part ways?
But if my memory's vibe, you're the one that left

2 step in the motherfucker, yeah
Everybody 2 step in the motherfucker
2 step in the motherfucker, everybody get up, yeah
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might be a little late
Hey but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we were right
But we're here to stay

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Travelling where the wind will take
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go"

237,Phora,I Think I Love You,"Roses are red and violets are blue
Why does every love song remind me of you?
Why can't I make my mind up and decide what to do
I'm trying to write these songs
I always end up writing about you
I hope that you don't mind, sometimes I think about you
And I wish I could press rewind
Whisper in my ear, she send chills down my spine
Some people travel across the world and still don't ever find
This thing we call love, angel in my eyes
Like you were send from up above
(Like you were send from up above)
Look, see I catch myself staring I hope you don't mind
Baby I'm just taking time to thank god that you mine
So anytime you need I'll come through
Nothing comes between us it's just me it's just you
I never knew that love was so true
And if I have to tell the truth, girl
I've never been in love before you

Baby I'm the one for you
And that's for real
Never been in love
I never got to feel
Certain type of love you give to me
Trust you give to me
This is just the way I feel

Baby I'm the one for you
And that's for real
Never been in love
I never got to feel
Certain type of love you give to me
Trust you give to me
This is just the way I feel

I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Look
You remind me of summertime and
Ice cones, sunshine, beach waves, night shows
Love songs, you the reason why I write those
You the reason why the heart emoji's in my iPhone
Every king need a queen
I swear that you the girl I used to see in my dreams
Back then love was never my thing
See I think I love you I just don't know if I know what it means
But, you take me to a place where I've never been
Let your guard down, you can let me in
When I'm feeling low you are my medicine
Make love till I give yo ass a set of twins
I hope it never ends, your loyalty never breaks it never bends
It only feels right, so fuck stayin' the night
Baby you should go pack yo bags
Come settle in

Baby I'm the one for you
And that's for real
Never been in love
I never got to feel
Certain type of love you give to me
Trust you give to me
This is just the way I feel

Baby I'm the one for you
And that's for real
Never been in love
I never got to feel
Certain type of love you give to me
Trust you give to me
This is just the way I feel

I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Reminiscing, had a vision
Getting married, having kids

And let's be honest only thing I'm raising is these fucking digits so
And all these rumors that you bitches start are probably true, I did it
Feeding lines of blow to models off a mirror in the kitchen

It's ironic and specific
Can't say they never saw themselves
Starting a problems with addiction

Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting..."

Just tryna find ya
I've been like a maniac insomniac
Five steps behind ya

Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit
Check please...
'Cause I finally found the girl of... my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shit girl
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl

Give me 25 to life

You're my biggest hit girl

Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

You can't help but turn them heads
Knockin' them dead
Dropping like flies around ya
If I get your body close not letting go
Hoping you're about to

Tell them other guys they can lose your number
You're done!
They don't get another shot 'cause you're... love drunk
Like a TV show playing reruns
Every chance I get
Imma turn you on

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shit girl
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl

Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock all night long

Through my, through my mind, mind
Just keep it coming, coming
Till I make you mine, mine
You've got that something, something

I wanna be with you girl
You're my greatest hit girl
Just say this is it girl...
Hey baby...
Don't you know you're my it girl?

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shit girl
Lovin' you could be a crime

255,G-Eazy;Black Bear,Remember You,"I will remember you
She got her own crib with a twin bed
In west Hollywood, she uptown
And she dance to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you
I will remember you

Yeah, back when the first time we met
I was thinkin' 'bout sex but you told me not yet
I meant no disrespect I was just being honest, my only regret was
Never letting you know how I felt or what was up
That was too much Maker's in my cup
I was faded, too fucked up
And you probably think I'm an asshole
Read your facial expression
But it's not everyday someone comes and leaves an impression
Typin' shit to say to you then deletin' it on my phone when I'm textin'
'Cause I still be thinkin' about you like every day, no question
But, I ain't really tryin' to fly out
And I'm no good at phones
And my life is on the road
I'm with the crew of Rolling Stones, but don't trip

I will remember you
She got her own crib with a twin bed
In west Hollywood, she uptown
And she dance to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you
I will remember you

See I know I've got this tendency to fall in love real quickly
But it's usually a phase I fall into in every city
That passes away instantly
When I leave it's over
I come to my senses when I'm sober
But I thought about you, no lie
When I left, you stayed on my brain
Then we finally got to fuck, and that shit was all the way insane
Now I know that you're havin' a thought
Picture us having a spot
But look at this baggage I got
My life is crazy, I travel a lot
But, when I dip out in the morning you can trust
I'll be thinkin' about you looking out the window of my bus

I will remember you
She got her own crib with a twin bed
And was Hollywood, she uptown
And she danced to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you
I will never forget you"
256,Akon,"Sorry, Blame It On Me - Main","As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that
I've done things that haven't occurred yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know

That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there

Because I'm in the streets like everyday
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there's some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me (4x)
Said you can put the blame on me (3x)
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just trying to stay busy until you heard from dad

When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree

He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief

I'm sorry that I grew up way to fast
I wish I would of listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

I understand that there's some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me

Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
But they were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani

I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
And for the embarrassment that she felt
She's just a little young girl trying to have fun
But daddy should have never let her out that young

I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say

Why doesn't anybody want to take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me

And you can put that blame on me

And you can put that blame on me"

No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level 'cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons 'cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

But I love it, the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it Cudi

In case you was wonderin', I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A, barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

And now I'm missin' your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

I blame it on the distance
Why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you

I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, that fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you

Just let me grow away from you

Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And cross the line just saying if you're down

Like I don't want it getting weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately

Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'

Real friends
Huh?

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him"

It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions

I think I've been in Hollywood for too long
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold

And real life is stranger than my dreams"

Is the pain that you been feeding
Faded, faded, faded
All because of you
And my current situation
Trying not to think of you, not to break the rules
Why it always happens, when I get this way?
Just can't stop myself

Looking at my phone thinking
Am I gonna hit send or not?
It's gonna be one of them moments when I wake up and regret it
If I don't get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm
Faded, faded, faded
Off a drink or two
And you know how it goes
This ain't nothing new
Why does it always happen, when I get this way?

I done spent 1, 2, 3 am thinking about you
Don't wanna be without ya
'Cause I'm on that liquid courage
I hope the shit is worth it

Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage

Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left,
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

Big Sean:
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

Ariana:
Break up, make up, total waste of time;
Can we please make up our minds

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up In a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights off
And put my number in it

I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you like Where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time
I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind is letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girls 100
And I want it, no question
I know destiny well and know I seen the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this, unfortunately
Means that I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not-I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance, at a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up-drug-related-mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a time sheet, that slow money
Picked up the family business
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina"", the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand-

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only-

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing when times was hard
I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your Momma, nigga; send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects-""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"", although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only"

You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love"

No
I shoulda figured though
All that shit you was spittin'
So unoriginal
But it was you
So I was with it
Then tell you the truth
Wish we never did it

'Cause I usually do
Stick to the business
But you came out the blue
And then you just flipped it
God damn baby
My mind's blown
Be forgettin'
You live in a different time zone
Think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
Yeah I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
This is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

And though
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I still want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Verse 1: Drake)
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out""

(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Verse 2: Drake)
Uh -
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life, I guess."" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Outro: Sampha)
Don't feel like, you give up
Your heart's done
Your love's done
Don't give up
Don't fake it
Don't have to..."

My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you

And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you

And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, It's all just memories

(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...Feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...Feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take...

Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise"

We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky.
With you, I'm alive
Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.
I'm just a sad song.

With you I fall.
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall.
With you I'm a beautiful mess.
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

You're the perfect melody,
The only harmony
I wanna hear.
You're my favorite part of me,
With you standing next to me,
I've got nothing to fear.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.

Let it roll right off your shoulder
Don't you know
The hardest part is over
Let it in
Let your clarity define you
In the end
We will only just remember how it feels

Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours still remain

Let it slide
Let your troubles fall behind you
Let it shine
Till you feel it all around you
And I don't mind
If it's me you need to turn to
We'll get by
It's the heart that really matters in the end

Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours still remain

All of my regrets
Will wash away somehow
But I could not forget
The way I feel right now...

In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Yeah, these twists and turns of fate

Time falls away
Yeah, but these small hours
These small hours still remain, yeah
Oh, they still remain

Oh, these twists and turns of fate

If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

Watch you wave goodbye like troubled seas

Do you forgive my spill?
Do you remember the way it did you feel?
Do you remember the things that let you feel?

How do I make you stay?

Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are""

They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone

But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are""

I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
'Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved

And I know that she gon' understand

Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under

And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under, oh

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
(Never let me go, never let me go)
(Never let me go, never let me go)

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean deliver me

Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
But now I am under, oh

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
(Never let me go, never let me go)
(Never let me go, never let me go)

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean deliver me

And it's over
And I'm going under
But I'm not giving up
I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet

And the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
In the arms of the ocean deliver me

Deliver me
(Never let me go, never let me go)
(Never let me go, never let me go)
Deliver me
(Never let me go, never let me go)
(Never let me go, never let me go)
Deliver me
(Never let me go, never let me go)
(Never let me go, never let me go)

And it's over
And I'm going under
But I'm not giving up
I'm just giving in
And I'm slipping underneath
Ooh, so cold and so sweet"

Pour a little salt, we were never here

Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Right at the moment, this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And in the morning, I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And now all your love is wasted
Then who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
And who will fall far behind?

Come on skinny love

305,Ron Pope,A Drop In The Ocean,"A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Just a drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep,
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,

It’s hard to fight these feelings
When it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back
when I’m holding you in my arms
We don’t need to rush this
Let’s just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don’t want to mess this thing up
No I don’t want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life
So baby I’m alright with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It’ll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It’s never felt so real
No it’s never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don’t want to mess this thing up
I don’t want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life
So baby I’m alright with just a kiss goodnight

No I don’t want to say goodnight
I know it’s time to leave
But you’ll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don’t want to mess this thing up
I don’t want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might

308,Rihanna,What Now,"I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Whoa, what now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me
What now?

Why am I doing this to myself?
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart

Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold, yeah
The more I try the less is working, yeah, yeah, yeah

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard, to follow your heart

But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are

Yes, no's, egos, fake shows, like boom
Just go and leave me alone
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
With a smile, that's my home, that's my home, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay

Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Slower, slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads

Have heart, my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear"

Somewhere in forever

I used to think that I was irreplaceable,
We lit the whole world up,
Before we blew it up,
I just don't know how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,

'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
Don't come back to me, don't come back at all

Never know why it's coming down, down, down.

Can't find another way around
And I don't want to hear the sound, of losing what I never found.

Nobody knows what she's holding back
Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with the linen and lace

Oh oh

The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel

Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbors hear but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes it will be too late

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel

A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world had forgot

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel"

Now I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done
Please baby, now
Wash me clean
Set my heart on fire
Like gasoline, baby now
Wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire,
Like gasoline, oh no, like gasoline
I wake up, the morning after
You call, but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye, no matter how hard I try
You deserve forever, not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here, Imma try to keep you near
Please baby, now
Wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Baby now, yeah

Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

327,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"

The palm trees swaying in the wind

You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me

And when you left you kissed my lips
You told me you would never, never forget
These images

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I'll bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be

My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache

With wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

Before daylight

In the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide, here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I wanna hear your beating heart tonight"

Out of the bearded barley
Nightly
Beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing
Swing the spinning step
I wear those shoes and
You will wear that dress

So kiss me
Beneath the milky twilight
Lead me
Out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me
Down by the broken tree house
Swing, swing
Upon it's hanging tire
Bring, bring
Bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked
On your father's map

Oh kiss me
Beneath the milky twilight
Lead me
Out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me
So kiss me

Kiss me
Beneath the milky twilight
Lead me
Out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance

I can take care of myself
I musn't let them down now,
Mustn't let them see me cry

I'm fine
I'm fine.

I'm too tired to listen
I'm too old to believe
All these childish stories
There is no such thing as faith and trust and pixie dust

I'll try, but it's so hard to believe
I'll try, but I can't see where you see

I'll try
I'll try
I'll try

My whole world is changing
I don't know where to turn
I can't leave you waiting
But I can't stay and watch this city burn
(Mmm) Watch it burn.

'Cause I'll try, but it so hard to believe
I'll try, I can't see where you see

I'll try
I'll try

I'll try and try to understand 
The distance in between
The love I feel
The things I fear 
And every single dream.

I can finally see it
Now I have to believe
All those precious stories
All the world is made of faith and trust and pixie dust

So I'll try 'cause I finally believe
I'll try 'cause I can see where you see

I'll try
I'll try
I will try
I'll try

Gonna make it really long
So that everyone can see
That I'm very unhappy

I wish I wasn't always wrong
I wish it wasn't always my fault
The finger that you're pointing
Has knocked me on my knees
And all you need to know is
I'm so sorry 
It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking 
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow

Wonder what my mom and dad would say
If I told them that I cry each day
Tired enough to live so far away

I wish I wasn't always cold
I wish I wasn't always alone
But the parties over 
How will I get home

And all you need to know is
I'm so sorry
It's not like me 
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow

The rules are meant to bend
And you swore you were my friend
Now I have to start all over again
No one's going to take your place
And I'm scared you'll never save
All the pieces of the love we made

And I'm so sorry
It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know
That I can slip and fall and you won't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow

And I'm so sorry
It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking

I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this
Is leaving you

Now turn away
'Cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony
Know that I will never marry

It just ain't living

That they've been sold out

That we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves
To the Gods they've made

My last goodbye
The words I need
Are in your eyes

She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore no

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore
Yeah yeah

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight
No  I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
Can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
and I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you told me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, you say someday you will change
But I don't want to wait"
346,Kodaline,All I Want,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

Ooh

If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
All I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait

Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand

I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me

Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you

I have loved you all along

For being away for far too long

Hold on to me and never let me go"
350,Nickelback,Lullaby,"I know the feeling of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing from cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
And take it from someone who's been where you're at
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
You can take this anymore

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you that you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done, you're far too young
And the best is yet to come

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well everybody's hit the bottom and everybody's been forgotten
Well everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned and left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hangin' on

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell

351,Rascal Flatts,What Hurts The Most,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most
Was being so close

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right

Nothing to prove

Everything she does is right

No I am yours
With crippled anger
And tears that still drip sore

A fragile flame aged
Is misery
And when our hearts meet
I know you see

I do not want to be afraid
I do not want to die inside just to breathe in
I'm tired of feeling so numb
Relief exists I find it when 
I am cut

I may seem crazy
Or painfully shy
And these scars wouldn't be so hidden 
If you would just look me in the eye
I feel alone here and cold here
Though I don't want to die
But the only anesthetic that makes me feel anything kills inside

I do not want to be afraid
I do not want to die inside just to breathe in
I'm tired of feeling so numb
Relief exists I find it when 
I am cut

Pain
I am not alone
I am not alone

I'm not a stranger
No I am yours
With crippled anger
And tears that still drip sore

But I do not want to be afraid
I do not want to die inside just to breathe in
I'm tired of feeling so numb
Relief exists I found it when
I was cut"

356,Jason Mraz,I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Of the nights we share
Ocala is calling

Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped to find in every single way
And everything I will give is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet and I need it

Been three whole days since I've had sleep

But we both know that I'm not that strong
And I miss the lips that made me fly

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry believe me

I'm so dependant
I'm such a fool

I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear
Can't face the truth

I was wounded and confused
As I watched the 10 o'clock news
I was waiting on a late night call
That I knew would never come
And though I doubt it's what you'd want
I call you from the steps outside
You say you were fast asleep
And every lies, it tortures me
I can't kill what does not bleed
So please explain

Can you tell me what it is you need?
'Cause I've been trying, still I cannot see
These wasted moments brought me to my knees
I just wanna give you everything

If morning is my darkest time
In the night I sometimes find
There is comfort without lie
I've been living with no hope
It was a shame to let it go
But it was drowning me so slow
I've never felt so far away
From the boy I used to be
And I wonder what he'd see
From the corner of some ship
He met me today

Can you tell me what it is you need?
'Cause I've been trying, still I cannot see
These wasted moments brought me to my knees
I just wanna give you everything

In the letter that you wrote me last
There were words that burned to hear
And red lipstick on the mirror
You said loving me's a great mistake
'Cause I have never loved myself
And I am sorry if you found
But maybe you could offer help
To someone like me

Can you tell me what it is you need?
'Cause I've been trying, still I cannot see
These wasted moments brought me to my knees
I just wanna give you everything"

On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded

Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor

As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love

Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been

And I know the worst of it
Wasn't all that it seemed

Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18

394,Snow Patrol,Chasing Cars,"We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"

396,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

397,Halsey,Coming Down,"I found God
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake

I found the Devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerine
In his color coded speak

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

A love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice

I've got a lover
And I'm unforgiving
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, I'm coming down
It's coming down, down, I'm coming down

I found a martyr
He told me that he'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs

I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
'Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play

This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And when I leave this island
I book myself into a soul asylum
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
You're half the world away

And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And if I can leave this spirit
I'll find me a home and I'll live in it
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

399,The Cinematic Orchestra,To Build A Home,"There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home

And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees

By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust"

Are sizzlin' like a snare

402,The Script,If You Could See Me Now,"(Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

It was February 14 Valentines Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
And explained I was young, he would say
Take that rage, put it on a page
Take that page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying ""That's my kid!""

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see me now would you recognize me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on my heart that was cold
As the day you were taken away
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me
Like I won't know real love till I've loved and I've lost it
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

Oh, oh
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, oh
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Yeah I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see, you could see me now
If you could see, you could see me now"
403,Lily Allen,Somewhere Only We Know,"I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need something to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place

But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain.
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote

Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line

And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

We are the reckless
We are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there

And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this

And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it

Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
A lifeless face that you'll soon forget
My eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest

And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it"

All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,

All of your street light eyes wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair, I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map and called for you everywhere

Have I found you, flightless bird?
Jealous, weeping
Or lost you, American mouth?
Big pill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos, those fishing lures
Thrown in the cold and clean blood of Christ mountain stream

I've been putting sorrow on the farest place on my shelf

And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall

And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

Now take me home, home where I belong
Now, now
Now take me home, home where I belong
Home, home
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now, now
Now take me home, home where I belong

I can't take it anymore"
416,Lana Del Rey,Born To Die,"Why? Who, me? Why?

Feet, don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks
Every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on the Friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Try'na take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time

Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Nicki Minaj
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more postin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn
But there was something I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Nicki Minaj
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't want to catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
They said that your darkest hour came before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Skylar Grey
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Skylar Grey
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes

But do you ever think of me, when you lie?

I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something, I'm giving up on you

So is it wrong to toss this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

How unfair, it's just our love
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up

421,Kehlani,The Letter,"I can hear your laugh.
It's ringing through the hallways.
I can see your smile
It's what gets me through my hard days
And your words
Were supposed to get me through my heartache
Before my heartbreak
There's an emptiness
That only few ever feel

And I somehow missed
The meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you
Maybe I don't understand it

Tell me is this how you planned it
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light
Must have done something to make you want to run and hide
Why oh why, Didn't you just live your life
And every girl needs a mother
And damn it, I needed you
Instead you dug for cover

And you ran from the truth
And like kids do
You waited around for proof
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you
And maybe I don't understand it

Tell me is this how you planned it
Do you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage
Maybe I didn't deserve you."

Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)

And know when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

Will give me just enough
To bury my love
In the moon dust
I long to hear your voice
But still I make the choice
To bury my love

Nothing can breathe, in this space
Colder than the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days
Driving through, your sunset breeze

But the first thing that I will do
Is bury my love for you

The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love
In the moon dust
I long to hear your voice
But still I make the choice
To bury my love
In the moondust

I'm a cast-away
And then reap what they sow
And I'll say what I know to be true
Yeah, I'm living far away
On the face of the moon
I've buried my love
To give the world to you

The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love
In the moon dust
I long to hear your voice

To bury my love

See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her

But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

446,Leona Lewis,Bleeding Love,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, oh"

448,Oh Wonder,Lose It,"Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones

Loose up we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?

Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Your name I'll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones

Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are from the start
Won't you dance with me?

Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are chasing stars
Won't you dance with me?
Won't you dance with me?

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it"

I've been too many places. I've seen too many faces

I was resurrected; never found a love like you (love like you)
Don't care where I'm headed when the world is ending

She leaves the lights on the tree
And though the New Year has come
Every night, they'll stay on for you to see

Always

451,The Fray,Happiness,"Happiness was just outside my window
I thought it'd crash blowing 80-miles an hour
But, happiness is a little more like knocking
On your door, you just let it in

Happiness feels a lot like sorrow
Let it be, you can't make it come or go
But you are gone, not for good but for now
And gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
'Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks

Happiness damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself that's enough for now
But happiness has a violent roar

Happiness it's like the old man told me
Look for it, and you'll never find it all
But let it go, live your life and leave it
Then one day, wake up and she'll be home
Home, home, home"

And every second passing reminds me I'm not whole

Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the unknown, unknown

Oh, blazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills

Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies

When you show up every night
And tell me that you want me but it's complicated
So complicated

When it hurts but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?

Your love is like

You pull away and I come in closer
And all we ever stay is torn

Will you hold me like we're running a yellow light
Reach for you with my hands tied
Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise

Do you take it? Do you break it off?

457,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

Busting my ass for someone who's not there

I'd love to reciprocate your love but I'm incapable
I know that you don't get it, but I'm just so unstable
And all I could think about is how you'd be unfaithful
You think that I am crazy

I chose to travel as a lonely man
So much that I lacked, so much that I lacked
I'm always wishing I was walking that road
It's something I hold, something I hold
I take it with me all the places I go
How little you know, how little you know

I only eat to fill me up
I only sleep to rest
I need a love just like you gave
I haven't found it yet, found it yet

See where I am is where I'm wanting to be
I know what I need, know what I need
And there are many different places to see
I know how to dream, know how to dream
Still there's a wound and I'm moving slow
Though it don't show, though it don't show
I've got a hole where nothing grows
How little you know little you know

476,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
477,Stephen,Sincerely,"I'm callin' this the love crusade
The truth is like a black bouquet
Money's got us all enslaved
The bullets and the bombs we make, Oh no
It doesn't have to be this way
But I promise it'll stay this way
If you would rather hear me say
That everything is all ok

I don't care for your drugs, I don't care for your fame
Do you care for the truth if you're not entertained?
I can see through your eyes, I can see through your pain
And you're scared to admit you feel out of place

Can you hear that darlin'
A revolution's callin'
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that darlin'
The monsters marchin
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely

I'm tellin' you the world looks perfect from a plane
A couple miles up and we all look the same
One love tryna show us the way
One love that is tryin' to change
And if we connect with that, then we should be enraged
These fat cats want us lost in the maze
And they're scared 'cause we're breakin' the chain
They're scared 'cause we're 'bout to escape

Can you hear that darlin'
A revolution's callin'
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that darlin'
The monsters marchin
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely

There's a billion people
That could use a hero
Come together, we're the tether
Of this love that's spinnin' round
We could be that miracle

Can you hear that darlin'
A revolution's callin'
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that darlin'
The monsters marchin
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely"
478,Kehlani,You Should Be Here,"I'm looking right at you, but you're not there
I'm seeing right past you, but you seem well aware
Your body is here, but your mind is somewhere else
So far gone and you think I can't tell
Can't tell that you are disconnected
You pulled away and I miss your presence
I always said to you

Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now

Head on your chest babe, but your heart is so quiet
We use to talk all night long, now we laying in silence
Your arms around me but your soul is somewhere else
Gone so long and I know you so well
I know that you are everything that I ever dreamed of
And hoped that love had a happy ending

Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now

You should be here, right, right here, yeah"
479,Lana Del Rey,Young And Beautiful,"I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can

All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm not young and beautiful?"
480,Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America"
481,Oh Wonder,Shark,"Standing on the world outside
Caught up in a love landslide
Stuck still, colour blind
Hoping for a black and white

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?
My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Walking on the clouds unknown
Drop down oh I will never go, never go, never go
Floating like gravity has grown
Reach down to a deep deep hole, deep hole, deep deep hole

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?
My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Standing on the world outside

Berlin in the cold
All that fighting, all that snow

Sober nights

And silence in my blood
Sorry love I'm running home
I'm a child of sun and the stars I love"
483,Nicki Minaj,Grand Piano,"Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were the one

Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

And now the people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

Am I being a fool?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
'Cause I keep thinking you were the one
Who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

And now the people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on

Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Spent the evening hungover, champagne for the night time blues
'Cause I got a new girl, she's nothin' like you
She don't do anything like you used to do
And I miss the thunder, in California
All the glory and wonder, where's the Southern Comfort?

In the winter, my brother, he said, ""Man, fuck her, find another""
Keep your head up, this is summer
Funny how I had that same younger attitude
My mother said, ""Don't rush to be grown
@Cause them valley girls will always have some growin' up to do""

I ain't lookin' for, lookin' for love
Just lookin' for someone to fuck
I ain't lookin' for, lookin' for love
I don't need none of that
'Cause I can't wait for you
Can't stay for you, won't change for you
And I don't want the same things as you
Not chasin' you, not blamin' you
But I don't want the same things

And forever goes a long way
I'm usually patient
I'm tired of waiting all the time
Usually faded all the time

I ain't lookin' for, lookin' for love
Just want you to want you to know
I'm just lookin' for, lookin' for somebody to fuck
Just for the night, I swear, I swear
If all you want is a quick fuck, then let's go

'Cause I can't wait for you
Can't stay for you, won't change for you
And I don't want the same things as you
Not chasin' you, not blamin' you
But I don't want the same things
No I don't want the same things
I don't want the same things
I ain't lookin' for, lookin' for love
I'm just lookin' for, lookin' for drugs
Just lookin' for, lookin' for drugs
Just lookin' for, lookin' for drugs
Just lookin' for, lookin' for drugs
Just lookin' for, lookin' for drugs"

Come settle down, settle down
Let loose your glow
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

Beat, beat, beat

Warm, unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

Give me one drop, I can feel you
Make me lose control
We'll be walking, on the water
When we're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat (Falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet (We're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me (Found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

I've been waiting so, so long
But here we are now
Here we are now
I will judge myself
Guilty of loving you too much
I will smother you just to feel your touch
I will offer you my whole self, not just my best

You can take me as I come or discard me like the rest
Take me by the hand
And show me to the world
I am nothing but a man
You are nothing but a girl

She's still out there and the chasm grows

Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, prepare us as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow on the ground, I hear my people screaming out

And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small
And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small
And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me"

510,Ruth B.,Superficial Love,"You're really cute, I must admit
But I need something deeper than this
I wanna know when I'm looking at you
That you don't only see the things you want to

'Cause I'm not perfect, I'm flawed
And if you don't like that, get lost
'Cause I don't want it if it's fake
I don't want it if it's just for show, for show
I just want it if it's real and I'm thinking I should let you know, you know

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
This superficial love

Fun at first, I won't deny
But I want more than just what meets the eye
I wanna know when you're looking at me
That you see deep into my personality

'Cause I want authentic, not just for fun
If this love is plastic, it'll break on us
'Cause I don't want it if it's fake
I don't want it if it's just for show
I just want it if it's real and I'm thinking I should let you know

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
This superficial love

I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
And this ain't right

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby, if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one

I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
And this ain't right, this superficial love"
511,Daughter,Smother,"I am wasted, losing time
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but we're not right

In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator

I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave
To follow
To follow
To follow
To follow

In the darkness I will meet my creators
They will all agree, I'm a suffocator
Suffocator
Suffocator

Oh no
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
My mother
Never to come out"
512,James Blunt,You're Beautiful,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

514,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"
515,Daughter,Medicine,"Pick it up, pick it all up
And start again
You've got a second chance
You could go home
Escape it all

It's just medicine
It's just medicine

You could still be, what you want to
What you said you were, when I met you

You've got a warm heart
You've got a beautiful brain
But it's disintegrating
From all the medicine
From all the medicine
From all the medicine

You been out of touch, you're so far away
Wishing you would tell me you're sorry
And you knew you made a big mistake
Close my eyes and try to forget you
But every time I do, I just see your face
After all this shit that we've been through
Why you so willing to walk away?

I don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down
I can't help it that I need ya (need ya)
I can't help it that I need ya (need ya)
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need ya (need ya)
(I can't help it that I need ya)

Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down, down

You left me with a craving I can't fill
Got me wonder what I had yesterday
Tell everyone I'm fine but I'm still
Just sitting here, choking on the aftertaste

Can't stay away from you, I try, I try
But you got a grip on my mind

I don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down
I can't help it that I need ya (need ya)
I can't help it that I need ya (need ya)
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me

519,Sleeping At Last,Turning Page,"I've waited a hundred years.
But I'd wait a million more for you.
Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do.

If I had only felt the warmth within your touch,
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush,
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough,
I would have known what I was living for all along.
What I've been living for.

Your love is my turning page,
Where only the sweetest words remain.
Every kiss is a cursive line,
Every touch is a redefining phrase.

I surrender who I've been for who you are,
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart.
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours,
Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along.
What I've been living for.

Though we're tethered to the story we must tell,
When I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well.
With a whisper, we will tame the vicious scenes.
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees"

Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
Down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
I'm ready to climb this mountain inside
Impossible heights

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me

I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to hope, swing me out of the low
Wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fly, uncover the light
Impossible heights

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me"

With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Oh, only to wake and hide your face

When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

But oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can"

Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music
Maybe then you'll score, oh oh

So come on baby, won't you show some class?
Why'd you have to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time

Good vibrations through & through, oh oh

526,Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Follow their plan

How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you?

I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy

Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved 
And she will be loved

I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when your really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)

And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinkin' about you
And its almost driving me wild

But it's my heart that's beggin down this long distance line tonight

And I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what I might say

There's a message in the wires
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And It looks like I'm loosein' this fight

But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine


But I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you at
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sendin' out
Like a telograph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter what, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.

You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's... that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is."

Did you know that you're beautiful?
Did you know you got me fucked up?
Did you know that you're gorgeous?

Alright, I can still remember how the weed smelled
When you were riding shotgun, no seat belt
Or the SS just taking hits
Sold that car and fucked up that relationship
I built up my walls perhaps too tall
Got issues with trusting but that's not all
Knots tied by fame and not easily undone
I fucked 200 women, said ""I love you"" to one
She used to speak like she was reading a scene
And make love like she was a model
The only thing about flames that bright
Is they tend to make mine seem darker

Did you know you're on fire?
Did you know that you're beautiful?
Did you know you got me fucked up?
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
Did you know that you're
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
Did you know that you're
Did you know that you're gorgeous?

Yeah, yeah, in and out of love
On and off of drugs
I ask you where you've been
And you give me shoulder shrugs
Pink polka dot top from Saint Laurent
I bought you but you never wore
And I don't even send the text
I know you just ignore
And I'm so high
Could be the drugs could be the moment
But either way I can't keep my eyes off you

Did you know you're on fire?
Did you know that you're beautiful?
Did you know you got me fucked up?

Here I am, with all my heart
I hope you understand
I know I let you down

You brought me closer
To who I really am
Come take my hand
I want the world to see
What you mean to me
What you mean to me

Just know that, I'm sorry
I never wanted to make you feel so small
A story is, just beginning
We'll let the truth break down these walls
Oh, yeah, yeah
And every time I think of you
I think of how you pushed me through
And showed me how much better I could be

Here I am, with all my heart
I hope you understand
I know I let you down
But I'm never gonna make
That mistake again
You brought me closer
To who I really am
Come take my hand
I want the world to see
What you mean to me
Yeah, yeah

You make me feel like I'm myself
Instead of being someone else
I wanna live that everyday
You say what no one else will say
You know exactly how to get to me
You know it's what I need
It's what I need
Yeah

Here I am, with all my heart

And nothing comes close 
To the way that I need you 
I wish I can feel your skin 
And I want you 
From somewhere within 

It feels like there's oceans 
Between me and you once again 
We hide our emotions 
Under the surface and try to pretend 
But it feels like there's oceans 
Between you and me 

I want you 
And I always will 
I wish I was worth 

But I know what you deserve 
You know I'd rather drown 
Than to go on without you 
But you're pulling me down 

It feels like there's oceans 
Between you and me once again 
We hide our emotions

Mostly I miss having you close to me
The only one who really ever knows me
And I'm sorry, I promise I'll do better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

Some nights, I kid myself I treated you right
Lying to myself, I didn't know
If I'm honest, I could've done it better
You said we had it pretty much perfect
And then you told me that you loved me
But you're sorry, you needed something better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

So I guess I'm gonna let you go
But you get to keep a little bit of my soul
So I guess I'm gonna write you out
But I don't think I can do it to me right now
Let's pretend that time heals all

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
But I'm not afraid to start again
Start again, gonna start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends
But I've gotta try to start again"

547,Mayday Parade,Miserable At Best,"Katie, don't cry
I know you're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go
Of the nights we share
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped to find in every single way
And everything I will give is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet and I need it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best

And this'll be the first time in a week that I'll talk to you
And I can't speak
Been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong
And I miss the lips that made me fly

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable

Pour a little salt, we were never here

Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different ""kind""
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love, what happened here
Suckled on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted?
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?"

She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?"

Checking your pulse just to feel it beat

I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no

So far away but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh no

That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me"
563,Lord Huron,The Night We Met,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"
564,Alessia Cara,River Of Tears,"Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had
I can't pretend that I don't miss you
Every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears

565,Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, ""Hallelujah
You're home"""

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

570,Snow Patrol;Martha Wainwright,Set The Fire To The Third Bar,"I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from me to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see

I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science

Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids

And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms"

Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one's listening
I nervously rehearsed for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed

And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

You set the other on fire. You set the other on fire"

But you pushed me over and over
Never thought I'd have a vice
Other than you, over and over

Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still

Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out, go out

I never thought a sunrise
Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight
Head spins like carousel, over and over

Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still

Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out, go out

Two more footsteps on the wood floor, but it ain't you
I'm faded so I bring someone home
Over and over, I do this and I'm still

Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

Too proud to say it, and I let you leave straight out of spite
And now I'm missing you, sometimes I wish you miss me too
Maybe you do, I'm hoping, but you're too proud to say it too
Maybe I've just been dreaming, dreaming that you'll come right back again, again, again

Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

I would just ask you
If I could ask someone I love, how it feels to lose someone

A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing

No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me

You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?"

586,Israel Kamakawiwo'ole,Over the Rainbow,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops

High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me, oh
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I?

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me
Oh, Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I?"
587,Ariana Grande;Nathan Sykes,Almost Is Never Enough,"I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right, but that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
We were so close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me, the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know, baby
Almost, baby, is never enough, baby
You know

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (is never enough, babe)
We were so close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you (babe)
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)

Almost is never enough baby

589,Christina Perri,Jar of Hearts,"I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart

Lost with no direction

But I, I gotta keep tryin'
Gotta keep my head held high

Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down but
No, I'm not breaking

I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

Something to get off my chest

Need something that I can confess

'Til all my sleeves are stained red 
From all the truth that I've said 
Come by it honestly I swear 
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear

I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far 
It's like we're chasing all those stars 
Who drive the shiny big black cars

And everyday I see the news 
All the problems that we could solve 
And when a situation rises 
Just write it into an album
Seen it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no, so

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Got no reason 
Got no shame 
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear

593,Elton John,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best"

That should be me, holdin' your hand

That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Ah
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you my friend

We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (lemme tell you)
When I see you again

Oh, oh, ooh

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"

603,Coldplay,Viva La Vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

605,Zac Brown Band,Goodbye In Her Eyes,"I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
It was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled

She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off his make-up
The life she wanted - it was gone
Prince Charming - I wasn't

But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
But like the tide her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Now she sees right through me

Should I hold on to what we've got
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes

I saw goodbye in her eyes

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He's gonna love the way you shine
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you need
(Goodbye)

With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)
Should I hold on
We will never make it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)

Should I hold on
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over"
606,Maroon 5,Sunday Morning,"Yeah...
Sunday morning rain is falling 
Steal some covers, share some skin 
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable 
You twist to fit the mold that I am in 
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do 
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 

That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 

Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
Paint a picture with my hands 
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
Change the weather, still together when it ends 

That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 
Yeah!

Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

You may not know
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah...
I'm a flower in your hair, I'm a flower in your hair
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah...

Get back here
Get back here, yeah..."

609,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"

I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
No nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us

That you found a girl and you're married now

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

Don't forget me, I beg

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

660,Sam Hunt,Break Up In A Small Town,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sitting there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

To fight with time and space

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare
The way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a young'un, you're looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, why you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin'

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bar tending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

Ooh, see I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, yeah
And I want you to know, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call the referee?

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances

Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me, oh no

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down

786,Ed Sheeran,Hearts Don't Break Around Here,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I've found loving inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah

Every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah"
787,Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
788,Ed Sheeran,Happier,"Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey yeah, hey yeah)

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"

Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh, take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, oh, for I, I can't help
Falling in love with you"
827,Sam Smith;John Legend,Lay Me Down,"Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright"
828,Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go"

Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you

You're the one that I love

She's givin' you now

I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much

I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinkin' about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whisperin'
The way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind

I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair

832,Adele,Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

833,Sam Smith,Stay With Me,"Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Pour a little salt, we were never here

Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Right at the moment, this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And in the morning, I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And now all your love is wasted
Then who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will fight?
And who will fall far behind?

Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

836,Ron Pope,A Drop In The Ocean,"A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Just a drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep,
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Everyone knew I
Liked the affect that you
Had on my eyes

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time
That I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And baby, yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Said, you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Hmm, and I'll never be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh baby, I bet
Sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one who's got away
Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God
I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
So through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
And I will always be the
(Best thing you never had)
(Best thing you never had)
Ooh best thing you never had

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, I will never be the
(Best thing you never had)
Oh, baby
I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around comes back around
What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

What goes around comes back around

What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)"

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not

Ya better hurry up before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talkin' 'bout, ""Girl I love you, you're the one.""
This just looks like a rerun

841,Rihanna,Unfaithful,"Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah"
842,Rihanna;Ne-Yo,Hate That I Love You,"(Rihanna)
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No...)

(Ne-Yo)
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did

(Rihanna)
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong

(Ne-Yo)
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

(Rihanna)
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (ooh whoa...)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh...)

(Ne-Yo)
You completely know the power that you have
The only one that makes me laugh

(Rihanna)
Said and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right

(Ne-Yo)
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

(Both)
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak...
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...

(Ne-Yo)
Yeah... ooh...

(Rihanna)
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, need you)
That's how much I need you

And I hate that I love you so...
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)

843,Birdy,Not About Angels,"We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to toss this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

How unfair, it's just our love
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

It's not about not about angels, angels"
844,Ne-Yo,So Sick,"Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do do do do do do do-do
Oh yeah

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone

And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah

(Enough is enough)
No more walkin' 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue 
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio? Oh

(Leave me alone) Leave me alone 
(Stupid love songs) Oh
Hey, don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?

845,Mariah Carey,We Belong Together,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sittin' here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything, I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling, now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here 'cause, baby
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio, singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now.""
Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station 
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together"
846,Alicia Keys,If I Ain't Got You,"Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all

847,Kelly Clarkson,Because of You,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"

Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can

All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will

Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start"

'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart

Reachin' for the phone, 'cause I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart

I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.

The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad

Catching teardrops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
And go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear, yeah oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper, oh woah
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper"
856,Glee Cast,Mine (Glee Cast Version),"Santana:
You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Ah, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye, 'cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise: you said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Oh

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now"
857,Justin Bieber,That Should Be Me,"Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
This pain is my heart (oh oh oh)

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me
That should be me, giving you flowers
That should be me
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
That should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
Oh-oh-oh-ohh
That should be me
Never should've let you go hey ey
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go"
858,The Weeknd;Ed Sheeran,Dark Times,"Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should've seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
And only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still calming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But an endless fog's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
Running in circles, that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

In my dark times I've still got some problems I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go
Pulling me back every time

In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me)
In my dark times taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would not keep
In my dark times this is all I could be
Only my mother could've loved me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times
In my dark times"
859,Ed Sheeran,I'm A Mess,"Ooh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not he end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you're my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I've only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you're my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I've loved my lover
For how long I've loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I've loved my lover
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I've loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I've loved my lover"
860,Ed Sheeran,Bloodstream,"I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line...

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in

861,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland

Went down in the flames
We sailed the ocean
And drowned in the waves
Built a cathedral
But we never prayed
We had it all, yeah
And we walked away

Point of no return and now
It's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you
But I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down
It's a long way down, from here

We had a mountain
But took it for granted
We had a spaceship
But we couldn't land it
We found an island
But we got stranded
We had it all
Who could've planned it?

It's just too late to turn around

I want to lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You'll have a hiding place you can go
I want to lend you my coat

Everything I need I get from you
Givin' back is all I wanna do

I want to build you a boat
One that's strong as you are free

My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

Would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are, the same
You saved me, but when you leave it's gone again

Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all

You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say

But I don't know you anymore

There's nothing where you used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

It crawled beneath my veins and now
I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

Torn

There's nothing where you used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
And nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor
Illusion never changed into something real

Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts sometimes

Morning has come and I have to go

I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard

But if we're strong enough to let it in
We're strong enough to let it go

Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out

If I look back to the start

Now I know, I see everything true
There's still a fire in my heart, my darling
But I'm not burning for you

We started it wrong and I think you know
We waited too long, now I have to go

I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard
But if we're strong enough to let it in
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now
Who says truth is beauty after all
And who says love should break us when we fall
But if we're strong enough to let it in
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now
Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now

Strong enough to let it go"

When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"

Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home

And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees

By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust"
876,A Fine Frenzy,Almost Lover,"Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
Images

You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
Images

And when you left you kissed my lips
You told me you would never, never forget
These images

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I'll bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do"

I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you, oh
Say something, I'm giving up on you

Say something, I'm giving up on you

I promise, you would recognize my faith

I wanna show you, how I've grown in this place
In this place, I'm not alone and I know I'll be okay

But it's always harder, when the winter comes to stay
When I can't help but remember, all the words I'd never say

And it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty

Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I'll love you faithfully

Everything is taller these days
Or maybe I feel smaller and time rushes away

There's so much I could show you
Oh, the great grandchildren have been laughing like we did when we were young
Oh, I've been laughing like we did when we were young

But it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty
Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I I'll love you faithfully

Oh, it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty

Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I I'll love you faithfully

Yeah, it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty

Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see

For the last time
It's the last chance to feel again
But you broke me
Now I can't feel anything

When I love you,
It's so untrue
I can't even convince myself
When I'm speaking,
It's the voice of someone else

Oh it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Oh the truth hurts
A lie's worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before

Oh what are we doing
We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us

Running back through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train when it's too late (too late)

Oh it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Well the truth hurts,
A lie's worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before

But we're running through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train
When we both know it's too late (too late)

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Well truth hurts,
A lie's worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before


Let me hold you for the last time
It's the last chance to feel again"

Where the hurt never meant
Starts to linger
On the pavement below
See a crack that I know
All the corners of you
All the bones that I knew
I said I would never come back
Screaming at the walls in jet black
Hurt until my words are out flat
Can I whisper it back?

What a waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone

There's a space in between

To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?

But hey, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
And darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
Down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
I'm ready to climb this mountain inside
Impossible heights

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me

I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to hope, swing me out of the low
Wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fly, uncover the light
Impossible heights

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me"

So delicate it shatters round my feet
And my hands they bleed
A stain I'll always remember
A stain that stays with me
But this changes you
Its harder now we're breaking
And I should know it's never right for me to say
That I wanted this
I know I can't but I can still recall

I gave it all,
Given up on luck my heads above the dust,
This love you broke
Come closer darling don't forget to fake
A smile you had
You tried so hard to fool yourself instead

You gave it all
Given up on luck your heads above the dust
You gave it all
I waited by the other side my friend
I've waited by the other side my friend
You'll find it funny when you're looking back some day
You gave it all

Given up on luck your heads above the dust
You gave it all
I waited by the other side my friend
You gave it all
I waited by the other side my friend"

And I'll be strong enough to try

When the static clears
And all is said and done
I will realize
That we all need someone

Will you lift me even higher

Said if you lift me up

Long way down
Feels like a long way down
Feels like a long way down
Like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave
Please don't leave me now

'Cause I can feel the rivers
Winding through the lands
Two lines, and a poet
Like a kind old rye
You know we could talk in that language
Only we understand

But you know

Love it feels like a long way down

But I've only got myself to blame for it, and I accept it now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy

But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, oh, when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts of all the people who have come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
And I do believe

Believe I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, oh, when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning
And the world keeps spinning around

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go"

The only one who really ever knows me
And I'm sorry, I promise I'll do better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

Some nights, I kid myself I treated you right
Lying to myself, I didn't know
If I'm honest, I could've done it better
You said we had it pretty much perfect
And then you told me that you loved me
But you're sorry, you needed something better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

So I guess I'm gonna let you go
But you get to keep a little bit of my soul
So I guess I'm gonna write you out
But I don't think I can do it to me right now
Let's pretend that time heals all

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
But I'm not afraid to start again
Start again, gonna start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends
But I've gotta try to start again"

Every time it rains, I get wet

Darling, I am still in love with you
As time passes by, it just intensifies
I know I'll never be with you again
I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes

I'll be trying, unable to stop
Look, here comes the very first drop

'Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you, I taste you, I can not forget
Every time it rains, I get wet

On sunny days I'm all right
I walk in the light
And I try not to think about the love I live without

But every time it rains, I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you, I taste you, I can not forget
Every time it rains, I get wet

'Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces (every time it rains)
So many memories the rain releases (many memory)
I feel you, I taste you, I cannot forget

A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys

Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me, I had never seen

Into me you see, into me you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me you see, into me you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready, is this intimacy

I was a ship, floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy
Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea

Into me you see, into me you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me you see, into me you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready, is this intimacy

Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open

'Til I'm sober
'Til I'm sober
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover

I'm fighting
Just trying
To tell myself that we'll work it out
But it's useless
The truth is
You're no good for me

You've got me hungover
Yeah

It goes over and over and over
And I've got to break away
But I know there's no escape

'Til I'm sober
'Til I'm sober
You've got me hungover
You've got me hungover

941,Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, ""Hallelujah
You're home"""
942,Lady Antebellum,Hurt,"If my memory gets the best of me
Then I'll always find an excuse
Yeah, I'll make believe, re-write history
Ignite a spark I can't undo

It always starts out simple like a conversation
Before I know it, I'm lost in your illumination

If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that

You're a carnival on a summer night
Gone too soon every time
Yeah, it's beautiful how you burn so bright
In the waste land you leave behind

If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that

If you call me up at 3AM
I'll run to the rescue, time and time and time again

If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that
You could hurt somebody like that
You could hurt somebody like that"

And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart, ooh

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"
948,We The Kings;Elena Coats,Sad Song (feat. Elena Coats),"You and I,
We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky.
With you, I'm alive
Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.
I'm just a sad song.

With you I fall.
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall.
With you I'm a beautiful mess.
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

You're the perfect melody,
The only harmony
I wanna hear.
You're my favorite part of me,
With you standing next to me,
I've got nothing to fear.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

Without you, I feel broke.

I saw the ship change course
And out in the waves your spirit lingers
As the ghosts rise up from the sea

Now my heart feels different
Shores between so distant

I am alone, I am free
No one's come and conquer me
Out in the waves, cast out to sea
You slip away from me

Sometimes I'm lost in a daydream
I'm trailing off to God knows where
The waters were still and I could see
The borders of your land

Now my heart feels different
Shores between so distant

I am alone, I am free
No one's come and conquer me
Out in the waves, cast out to sea
You slip away from me

You slip away from me
You slip away from me
You slip away from me"

(Oh oh oh)

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't
Please don't go

Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go"
976,James Blunt,Goodbye My Lover,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow"
977,The Civil Wars,Poison & Wine,"You only know what I want you to
I know everything you don't want me to
Your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine
You think your dreams are the same as mine

Ooh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I always will

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
The less I give, the more I get back
Ooh, your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice, but I still choose you

Ooh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will

I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I always will

I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will"
978,Ultra Nate,It's Crying Time,"I was your girl
I was your baby

Remember
I was forever
For worse or for better
Faithfully
Told you my secrets
And all of my fears
You let me
Gave me your love

And said it was real
A fantasy

Something so good
Should last forever
How could you lie
So carefully
Falling apart
Will I recover
Lying alone
I sit and wonder
For now



It's crying time
Love is gone
I still need you
I gave you all my heart
You took the best
And threw the rest away

Shame on you boy
You should of known better
You didn't care
The joke is on me
But I am not laughing
Just sit and stare
Disguised
Like a knight in shining armor
An illusion

Playing a role
And now the show's over
I'm broken"
979,Adele,Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah..."

And I could see it written all over you
Since you already know
That I said ""sorry, but I gotta go""

And I'll rip these walls apart
And I went and shot an arrow right through your heart
But how those times have changed
Cause now you don't remember my name

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change, cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I guess I played my cards too late
Cause now my body can't take the weight
And once we flew so high, oh
But now I'm afraid to fly, oh oh oh

And please don't turn my heart away

987,Nicole Scherzinger,Run,"Here's some advice for the next one
Don't let him lead you to the dark
Don't tell him all your secrets
He'll leave you with a broken heart

He'll try and tell you that he wants you
Just to keep you on the line
Arrive in Europe
About to move on
He pulls you back every time

Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run

Darling, I know that you're just like me
You give your love up way too fast
But once it's gone 
It's gone forever

And there's coming back from that
He's got this perfect way about him
He'll make you think that you come first
But you'll get lost in the challenge
You're trying not to get hurt

Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run

Don't even search for that four-letter world
You'll never get it out
You try and try
And try

But he'll just shut you down
Don't wanna say I told you so
So please go now

Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advice for the next one

Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oh

Little did we know at the time
We had so much of us still to find
With our young and innocent minds
So beautifully blind

It's a pretty rare happiness, that we know
And a pretty cold sadness, if it goes
The fear of falling too far away
So out of reach, that you can't catch me one day

All this glitter and dust
Flying 'round the words in our mouths
Can't stay, let it out, let it out
Everything and even nothing
I feel your tears in my eyes
Looking out, waiting for a chance
To break, let it out, you let it out
Everything and even nothing

Is it just my own heavy head
That's making me so cold in your bed
I used to feel like nothing could touch us
And maybe you feel the same

It's a pretty rare happiness, that we know
And a pretty cold sadness, if it goes
The longer we pretend it's alright
We'll start exploding and be too weak to fight

All this glitter and dust
Flying 'round the words in our mouths
Can't stay, let it out, let it out
Everything and even nothing
I feel your tears in my eyes
Looking out, waiting for a chance
To break, let it out, you let it out
Everything and even nothing

Even if you think it's nothing
Oh-ooh-oh-oh

Flying 'round the words in our mouths

You got wires coming out of your skin
You got tears making tracks
I've got tears that are scared of the facts

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflect in your eyes

You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin
There's dry blood on your wrist
Your dry blood on my fingertip

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now you would never know

I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright

997,Roxette,It Must Have Been Love,"Must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)

That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind

That you'd be better off...
Besides...
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge

Turning inside out...
Turning inside out...

Tell me...
Why
Tell me...
Why

This is the book I've never read
These are the words I've never said
This is the path I'll never tread

This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel

So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?

If we fight what's true, will we ever be
Even God himself and the faith I knew
Shouldn't hold me back, shouldn't keep me from you

Tease me, by holding out your hand
Then leave me, or take me as I am
And live our lives, stigmatized

I can feel the blood rushing though my veins
When I hear your voice, driving me insane
Hour after hour day after day
Every lonely night that I sit and pray

Tease me, by holding out your hand
Then leave me, or take me as I am
And live our lives, stigmatized

We live our lives on different sides
But we keep together you and I
Just live our lives, stigmatized

We'll live our lives, We'll take the punches everyday
We'll live our lives I know we're gonna find our way

I believe in you
Even if no one understands
I believe in you, and I don't really give a damn
If we're stigmatized
We live our lives on different sides
But we keep together you and I
We live our lives on different sides

We gotta live our lives
Gotta live our lives
Were gonna live our lives
We're gonna live our lives, Gonna live our lives
Stigmatized

Well I'll write you a letter

To say my last goodbye
I just think it's time for me to go away
Cause the sun it seems to sink now
Like my love into her grave
This life is not yet over
But it doesn't need to be saved
Well the chambers of my heart
They echo all the same
I'm a solitary man
Who drives himself insane
Well we'll all come back
And we'll smile once again
I'll try and try, until I die, to make you understand
My love, I'll make you understand"

Blood running hot, night chills.
Without your love I'll be,
So long and lost, are you missing me?

Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive?
I hear its sad song.

I need the clouds to cover me,
Pulling them down, surround me.
Without your love I'll be,
So long and lost, are you missing me?

Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now all stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive?
I hear its sad song.

It's been so long between the words we spoke,
Will you be there up on the shore, I hope.
You wonder why it is that I came home,
I figured out where I belong.

But it's too late to come on home,
Are all those bridges now old stone?
But it's too late to come on home,
Can the city forgive?
I hear its sad song."

I'm just so tired to share my nights
I want to cry and I want to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love another love
All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart
And I want to cry, I want to learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart
And I want to cry, I want to fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up"
1007,Ron Pope,A Drop In The Ocean,"A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Just a drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep,
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,

Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore no, no
Heaven doesn't seem far away.
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore no, no

Aooo

I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.
You are my heaven"
1008,The Corrs,What Can I Do,"I haven't slept at all in days
It's been so long since we have talked
And I have been here many times
I just don't know what I'm doing wrong

What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there

There's only so much I can take
And I'm just gonna let it go
And who knows I might feel better, yeah
If I don't try and I don't hope

What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there

No more waiting, no more 
Aching
No more fighting, no more 
Trying

Maybe there's nothing more to say
And in a funny way I'm calm
Because the power is not mine
I'm just gonna let it fly

What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there
Just tell me what to do

What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What will it take to make you feel it
What can I do to get you there

And love me, love me, love me..."
1009,Maria Mena,I Don't Wanna See You with Her,"It's a small town, word gets around
And travels in circles through hoops over hurdles
Everyone's careless
They talk about our mess
They don't care how it hurts me
Must think it was easy

They say you have a new love
I'm happy for you, love
I just don't wanna meet her
Are you gonna keep her?

'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace
Her feets standing in my place
I don't wanna see you moved on
I don't think that I'm that strong
It hasn't been that long
Since I was the one in your arms

I don't like being sober
That's when it hits me it's over
All though it was my choice
I can't shake your calm voice
Saying you found one that makes you feel as strong
And helps you through hard times
'Cause that job was once mine

They say you have a new love
I'm happy for you, love
I just don't wanna meet her
Are you gonna keep her?

'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace
Her feets standing in my place
Guess I don't wanna see you moved on
I don't think that I'm that strong
It hasn't been that long
Since I was the one in your arms
I don't wanna see you with her

I don't wanna see you with her
'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace
Her feets standing in my place
Oh, I don't wanna see you moved on

Since I was the one in your arms
'Cause I don't wanna see you with her"

On my face
In my dawn and new day
I finally got away
But my head's all messed up and he knows
Just what to say
No more dawn and new days
I'm going back to stay
So why say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burning every time we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I still
Be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

We are going down
'Cause you're always getting high
And your crumbs of lovin'
No longer get me by
Wow! It gets better every time that we get high
Then your crumbs of lovin'
They somehow get me by
Why say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin when he call me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burning every time we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I still
Be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

Can't I go my severed way
Some rain for my sunny day
Not even one reason to stay
Why?
I should've left you
Why?
I can't forgetcha baby
Why?
Ever since I metcha it's
Why?

I still
Light up like a candle burnin when he call me up

Down that crooked road of sin
My momma locked me out again
And hung me high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

When I sing my stranger blues
I make it on the local news
Everybody likes to see you lose
And hang you high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

Little bluebird at my window
Sing a pretty song for me
Don't you know that you can fly, fly, fly away
Don't you know that you can leave

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb"
1013,Coldplay,Trouble,"Oh no, I see
A spider web, it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done

I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

Singing I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me"

1015,Aqua,Turn Back Time,"Give me time to reason
Give me time to think it through
Passing through the season
Where I cheated you

I will always have a cross to wear
But the bolt reminds me I was there
So give me strength
To face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night, for the night

Claim your right to science
Claim your right to see the truth
Though my pangs of conscience
Will drill a hole in you

I've seen it coming like a thief in the night
I've seen it coming from the flash of your light
So give me strength
To face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay

The bolt reminds me I was there
The bolt reminds me I was there

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time

The heat was rising
And now we're breathing more and more

Can you see me now?
Can you hear me shout?
When I'm dancing through the fear.
Will you catch my fall?
Do you know me at all?
It's like you never notice me
It's like you never notice me

I'm still trying
I'm not tired just yet
My eyes are drying
I never dreamed that you'd forget

Can you see me now?
Can you hear me shout?
When I'm dancing through the fear.
Will you catch my fall?
Do you know me at all?
It's like you never notice me
It's like you never notice me

In my room there was doubt,
Now no words can come out
We were friends we had heat
Now I choke when you speak
Because you never notice me.
Because you never notice me!

Can you see me now?
Can you hear me shout?
When I'm dancing through the fear.

Why carry on without me?

Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done? 
You seem to move on easy 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night, I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me

All the fighting now, we both moved on
Wonder where we'll be
A thousand days from here we'll see

Oh, I'd still run to stop you falling to the ground

Did you ever think we'd get on better

All this hurt

Know where to start

Anger, love, confusion
Rolls the gold nowhere
I know that somewhere better
Cause you always take me there

Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lying here
Will you take me home?

Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?

Count 1, 2, 3
If it helps me walk away then it's
What I need

The more you talk to me
You rationalize my darkest thoughts
Yeah you, set them free

Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
1031,Birdy,Deep End,"Someone told me that I'll want more
That I'll feel half empty, ripped and torn
They say there'll be plenty other hands to hold
Now I wish they'd told me long ago

Ooh, I don't want this to break you
Ooh, but I've got no one else to talk to

I don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend,
That we're not falling into the deep end?

You've gone quiet, you don't call
And nothing's funny anymore
And I'll keep trying to help you heal
I'll stop you crying and dry your tears

Ooh, I don't want this to break you
Ooh, but I've got no one else to talk to

I don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend?

Ooh, how do we mend?
Ooh, I didn't choose to depend on you
It's out of our hands
Maybe it will work out in the end

I don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend?

Don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend,
That we're not falling into the deep end?"
1032,Everything But The Girl,Missing,"I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, ho
Like the deserts miss the rain

And could you be dead
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run

I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I'm back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging round your old address

And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you, ho oh
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
(And I miss you)

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again

1033,City and Colour,Lover Come Back,"Bound for trouble
From the start
I've been walkin' through this old world
In the dark
All alone
Right by my side
There you were shinin'
My ray of light
So I'll sing lover come back
Lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back
Ever come back to me?
How could I have been so foolish
To let you leave
Lover come back
Lover come back to me
I'll never be
As good as I'd like to be
Eternally restless with reason to believe
But I think that we missed our connections
I wanted to feel your affection
Until my final days
I'll sing lover come back
Lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back
Ever come back to me?
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
Lover come back
Lover come back to me
I am warm enough
Yet I still shiver
I am fair but still I starve
You know me
I am the greatness giver
Always waitin' on the clouds to part
I'll sing lover come back
Lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back
Ever come back to me?
How could I have been so foolish
To let you leave?
So lover come back
Lover come back to me
Lover come back

Won't you ever come back
Ever come back to me?
How could I have been so foolish
To let you leave?
So lover come back

1034,Christina Aguilera,Hurt,"Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh-hoo, ooohooo

I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there

Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, oh

Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back

Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohoho

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Ohoho, it's dangerous, it's so out of line
To try to turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you"

1036,Daughter,Youth,"Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line

And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

We are the reckless
We are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there

And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this

And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it

Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
A lifeless face that you'll soon forget
My eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest

And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it"
1037,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

1039,Birdy,Skinny Love,"Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Right at the moment, this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And in the morning, I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My my my, my my my, my my my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And now all your love is wasted
Then who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
And who will fall far behind?

Come on skinny love

As I'm leaving the one I want to take
Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you

There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you won't you, be the one I always know

1041,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"
1042,We The Kings;Elena Coats,Sad Song,"You and I,
We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky.
With you, I'm alive
Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.
I'm just a sad song.

With you I fall.
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall.
With you I'm a beautiful mess.
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

You're the perfect melody,
The only harmony
I wanna hear.
You're my favorite part of me,
With you standing next to me,
I've got nothing to fear.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

1043,The Fray,You Found Me,"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?"
1044,The Fray,Never Say Never,"Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without, just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Picture: you're the queen of everything
As far as the eye can see, under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time, time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

We're falling apart and coming together again and again
We're coming apart but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

1046,The Fray,Where the Story Ends,"Trying not to lose my head but I have never been this scared before
Tell you what I'll do instead, lay my body down on the floor
To forget what I've done, silhouette till the good lord come

All we know is distance
We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one

Trying not to lose your own, boxing up everything, you've got
All you ever knew of home, you're scared scared to see
Your mother there in the door, you wonder where did the years go

All we know is distance
We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one
But this is how the story ends
Or have we just begun
To kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one

The violins make no sound
And I begin to feel the ground

All we know is distance
We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one
But this is where the story ends
Or have we just begun
To kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one"
1047,The Fray,Enough for Now,"The daughter's father watches, quietly we assume
He's not longer with us but he left this dusty room
In your name and it's an honor, it's a shame but it's your honor
Take it on your shoulder 'til you can find another

That's enough for now, he should've never left you broken
He should've held you, things your father never could do
That's enough for now, he would've never left you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you

The century before you never could turn 21
Years and years he waited just watching for a son
For someone to go ahead, take the name he said
Years and years he waited and a daughter came instead

But that's enough for now, he should've never left you broken
He should've held you, things your father never could do
That's enough for now, he would've never left you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you

Breathing comes in pairs
Except for twice
One begins and one's goodbye

Sixty years of sorrow, he got five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss

But that's enough for now, he never wanted to leave you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you
That's enough for now, I would've never left you broken
I would've held you, things your father never could do
Words your father never told you

Sixty years of sorrow, he got five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss"
1048,The Fray,Ungodly Hour,"Don't talk, don't say a thing
Cause your eyes they tell me more than your words
Don't go, don't leave me now
'Cause they say the best way out is through

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour

I know you're leaving now
'Cause I held on to my way tightly
Stay still until you know
Tomorrow finds the best way out is through

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour"
1049,The Fray,Happiness,"Happiness was just outside my window
I thought it'd crash blowing 80-miles an hour
But, happiness is a little more like knocking
On your door, you just let it in

Happiness feels a lot like sorrow
Let it be, you can't make it come or go
But you are gone, not for good but for now
And gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
'Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks

Happiness damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself that's enough for now
But happiness has a violent roar

Happiness it's like the old man told me
Look for it, and you'll never find it all
But let it go, live your life and leave it
Then one day, wake up and she'll be home
Home, home, home"
1050,The Fray,Over My Head (Cable Car),"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

But that's how it's got to be
It's comin' down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along

But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, oh

And suddenly, I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless

Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind"
1051,The Fray,Hundred,"The how I can't recall
Now I'm staring at what once was the wall
Separating east and west
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight

So this is where you are, and this is where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

It's hard I must confess
But I'm banking on the rest to clear away
'Cause we have spoken everything
Everything short of ""I love you""

You right where you are, from right where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred

And who's to say it's wrong
And who's to say that it's not right
Where we should be for now

So this is where you are, and this is where I am
So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
And this is where I've been
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred"
1052,Train,Drops of Jupiter,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?"
1053,Coldplay,Fix You,"When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"
1054,Coldplay,The Scientist,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start"
1055,Coldplay,Yellow,"Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called ""Yellow""

So, then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to've done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn it into something beautiful
D'you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful

While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I've got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

She's in line at the door with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while yeah

1057,The Script,Nothing,"Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet

They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many I know that I'm never
Only they can see where this is gonna end
And they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around

I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her 
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses 
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting she'll take me back for sure

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around

And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her 
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

She said nothing
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh I got nothing
Nothing
I got nothing
Nothing
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

Oh, sometimes love is intoxicating
Oh, you're coming down,
Your hands are shaking
When you realize there's no one waiting

Am I better off dead?
Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now
Than I ever was with her

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around

And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her

1061,The Script,The Man Who Can't Be Moved,"Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying if you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a brokenhearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here.""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows.
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go.""

Oh whoa
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved

1062,The Script,Before the Worst,"It's been a while since the two of us talked
About a week since the day that you walked
Knowing things would never be the same
With your empty heart and mine full of pain
So explain to me, how it came to this
Take it back to the night we kissed
It was Dublin city on a Friday night
You were vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night

We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought, but never heard
Who would have thought it would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

Before the worst, before we mend
Before our hearts decide
It's time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Lets try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

There was a time, that we'd stay up all night
Best friends talking 'til the daylight
Took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose, but so much to gain
Are hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss,
Set you a drift on memory bliss
It was Grafton Street on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Who would have thought it would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

Before the worst, before we mend
Before our hearts decide
It's time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

If the clouds don't clear
Then well rise above it, well rise above it
Heaven's gate is so near
Come walk with me through
Just like we used to, just like we used to

Let's take it back
Before it all went wrong

Before the worst, before we mend
Before our hearts decide
It's time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong"

So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I’m telling you to take your shot
It might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

Together we can just let go
Pretending like there’s no one else here that we know
Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays
We don’t care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I’m telling you to take your shot

1064,Howie Day,Collide,"The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find, you and I collide

I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find, you and I collide

Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find, you and I collide

You finally find 
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide"
1065,Mumford & Sons,Believe,"You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Preset all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these halls

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Oh say something, say something
Something like you love me
Unless you wanna move away
From the noise of this place?

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind"
1066,Ed Sheeran,Friends,-1
1067,Ed Sheeran,U.N.I.,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been 'ere before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes

Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
I stumble and fall with the head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore, now it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said that we'll be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you

Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great but everything's short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And everything I say seems to always sound awkward

Like our last kiss, it was perfect
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying every day that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore, now it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh, you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down, oh
And I'm thinking that I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
I keep looking around, to make sure I'm not
The only one to feel low

Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied"

'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya

No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around

1069,Kodaline,All I Want,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

Ooh

If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
All I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh"
1070,Birdy,Not About Angels,"We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to toss this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

How unfair, it's just our love
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

It's not about not about angels, angels"
1071,Demi Lovato,Fix A Heart,"It's probably what's best for you, I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best then you're stuck
I tried to server ties and I, ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts

I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Even though I know what's wrong, how could I be so sure
If you never say what you feel, feel
I must have held your hand so tight, you didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah

You must be a miracle worker
Swearin' up and down you can fix what's been broken yeah
Please don't give my hopes up, no, no
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel

It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Oh no, no, no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no, no, no
You never really can fix heart

You never really can fix my heart"
1072,Jason Walker,Echo,"Hello, hello
Anybody out there? 'Cause I don't hear a sound
Alone, alone
I don't really know where the world is but I miss it now

I'm out on the edge and I'm screaming my name
Like a fool at the top of my lungs
Sometimes when I close my eyes I pretend I'm all right
But it's never enough

Cause my echo, echo
Is the only voice coming back
My shadow, shadow
Is the only friend that I have

Listen, listen
I would take a whisper if that's all you had to give
But it isn't, isn't
You could come and save me and try to chase the crazy right out of my head

I'm out on the edge and I'm screaming my name
Like a fool at the top of my lungs
Sometimes when I close my eyes I pretend I'm all right
But it's never enough

Cause my echo, echo
Is the only voice coming back
My shadow, shadow
Is the only friend that I have

I don't wanna be down and
I just wanna feel alive and
Get to see your face again

I don't wanna be down and
I just wanna feel alive and
Get to see your face again

But till then
Just my echo, my shadow
You're my only friend and I'm

I'm out on the edge and I'm screaming my name
Like a fool at the top of my lungs
Sometimes when I close my eyes I pretend I'm all right
But it's never enough

Cause my echo, echo
Oh my shadow, shadow

Hello, hello
Anybody out there?"
1073,Bastille,Oblivion,"When you fall asleep
With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Oh, only to wake and hide your face

When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

But oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can"
1074,Birdy,Wings,"Sunlight comes creeping in
Illuminates our skin
We watched the day go by
Stories of all we did
It made me think of you
It made me think of you

Under a trillion stars
We danced on top of cars
Took pictures of the stage
So far from where we are
They made me think of you
They made me think of you

Oh lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly
For the rest of our lives

I'm in a foreign state
My thoughts, they slip away
My words are leaving me
They caught an aeroplane
Because I thought of you
Just from the thought of you

Oh lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly

Oh damn these walls
In the moment, we're ten feet tall
And how you told me after it all
We'd remember tonight
For the rest of our lives

If these wings could fly

Oh lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly

Oh damn these walls
In the moment, we're ten feet tall
And how you told me after it all
We'd remember tonight
For the rest of our lives"
1075,Demi Lovato,Warrior,"This is a story that I have never told
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
You're a criminal
And you steal like you're a pro

All the pain and the truth, I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused, I was broken and bruised

And now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

Out of the ashes, I'm burning like a fire
You can save your apologies, you're nothing but a liar
I've got shame, I've got scars, that I will never show
I'm a survivor
In more ways than you know

'Cause all the pain and the truth, I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused, I'm not broken or bruised

'Cause now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me

There's a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
All it took was once, I'll never be the same
Now I'm taking back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
'Cause you are never gonna take the blame anyway

Now I'm a warrior, I got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

No, oh yeah yeah
You can never hurt me again"
1076,Parachute,Kiss Me Slowly,"Stay with me, baby stay with me,
Tonight don't leave me alone.
Walk with me, come and walk with me,
To the edge of all we've ever known.

I can see you there with the city lights,
Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes.
I can breathe you in.
Two shadows standing by the bedroom door,
No, I could not want you more than I did right then,
As our heads leaned in.

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be,
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.

Stay with me, baby stay with me,
Tonight don't leave me alone.
She shows me everything she used to know,
Picture frames and country roads,
When the days were long and the world was small.
She stood by as it fell apart,
Separate rooms and broken hearts,
But I won't be the one to let you go.

Oh, I'm not sure what this is gonna be,
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.

Don't run away...

And it's hard to love again,
When the only way it's been,
When the only love you know,
Just walked away...
If it's something that you want,
Darling you don't have to run,
You don't have to go...

Just stay with me, baby stay with me.

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be,
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below. (Don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.

Oh, I'm not sure where this is gonna go,
But in this moment all I know
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below. (Baby, don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly."
1077,Demi Lovato,In Case,"Pictures in my pocket
Are faded from the washer
I can barely just make out your face
Food you saved for later
In my refrigerator
It's been too long since later never came

I know
One day eventually
Yeah I know
One day I'll have to let it all go

But I keep it just in case
Yeah I keep it just in case
In case
You don't find what you're looking for
In case
You're missing what you had before
In case
You change your mind I'll be waiting here
In case
You just want to come home

Strong enough to leave you
But weak enough to need you
Cared enough to let you walk away
I took that dirty jacket
From the trash right where you left it
'Cause I couldn't stand to see it go to waste

I know
One day eventually
Yeah I know
One day I'll have to let it all go

But I keep it just in case
Yeah I keep it just in case
In case
You don't find what you're looking for
In case
You're missing what you had before
In case
You change your mind I'll be waiting here
In case
You just want to come home

In case
You're looking in that mirror one day and miss my arms
How they wrapped around your waist
I say
That you can love me again
Even if it isn't the case

Oh
You don't find what you're looking for
Oh
You're missing my love

You don't find what you're looking for
In case
You're missing what you had before
In case
You change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case
You just want to come home
In case"
1078,Sia,Breathe Me,"Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me"
1079,Ross Copperman,Holding On And Letting Go,"Is anybody out there?
Is anybody listening?
Does anybody really know if it's the end of the beginning?
The quiet rush of one breath
Is all we're waiting for
Sometimes the one we're taking
Changes every one before...

It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go

Sometimes we're holding angels
And we never even know
Don't know if we'll make it,
But we know,
We just can't let it show

It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
Yeah, letting go

It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go

It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go."
1080,Matt Simons;Deepend,Catch & Release (Deepend remix),"There's a place I go to
Where no one knows me
It's not lonely
It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up
Find out what I'm made of
The nights I stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me on to the place where one reviews life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day

It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell eachother secrets
And remember how to love

There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in
They can be terrifying
To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
The end where we begin

So let it wash over me
I'm ready to lose my feet
Take me on to the place where one reviews life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day

It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell eachother secrets
And remember how to love

Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day

And it gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell eachother secrets
And remember how to love"
1081,Bastille,Overjoyed,"Oh, I feel overjoyed
When you listen to my words
I see them sinking in
Oh, I see them crawling underneath your skin

Words are all we have
We'll be talking, we'll be talking
These words are all we have
We'll be talking

And I hear you calling in the dead of night
And I hear you calling in the dead of night

You lean towards despair
Any given opportunity you're there
But what is there to gain?
When you're always falling off the fence that way

Words are all we have
We'll be talking, we'll be talking
These words are all we have
We'll be talking

And I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night

I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time

And oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone?
With the twilight
With the twilight

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't

Oh babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you lie
One last time
Just one last time

But oh babe, I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't

And we can talk it round again girl
Round and round, round and round again
Or we could leave it out to die
Leave it out, just leave it out

I never tried to trick you babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just want to hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night"

Making our way back from Mars

Time to buy and time to lose

A kid on the way, babe

Chasing the years of my life

Time to buy and time to lose yourself
Within a morning star

15, I'm all right with you
15, there's never a wish better than this

Half the time goes by
Suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye

The sun is getting high
We're moving on

I'm dying for just another moment

Counting the ways to where you are

On the TV they said they had reported you dead
It was my fault 'cause I could've sworn that you said
It was easy to find another for your bed

How does it feel to leave me this way
When all that you have's been lost in a day?
Everyone knows, but not what to say
I've been wonderin' now

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now

When my eyes open morning pulls me into the view, no
I guess I'm only acting in the way that you do
Just being alone, no
Only time tells me more than I hope, all that I know is
I'll be finding a fortnight alone and behold
I know I shouldn't have let you go

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this

When you wake up and you find that I'm not there, cry for me.

Put on your makeup
And just let down your hair,
Don't lose sleep.

I know you said we're fine, but I'm not sold.
You try to take two halves to make them whole.

And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole
And make them whole.

And make them whole.
Make them whole
Make them whole
Oh oh

When I wake up
And I reach across the bed,
You're not there.

Tried to save us,
But no one ever said
Love was fair.

I know you said we're fine but I'm not sold.
You try to take two halves to make them whole.

And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole.

Although you say you're fine but I'm not here to say goodbye,
I'm sick of wastin' all this time when we both know.

Yeah

Life can move so fast I know we run in different paths
But can we try to take two halves to make them whole.

And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole."

Regret, remorse, hold on, oh no I've got to go
There's no starting over, no new beginnings, time races on
And you've just gotta keep on keeping on
Gotta keep on going, looking straight out on the road
Can't worry 'bout what's behind you or what's coming for you further up the road
I try not to hold on to what is gone, I try to do right what is wrong
I try to keep on keeping on
Yeah I just keep on keeping on

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road

I've woken up in a hotel room, my worries as big as the moon
Having no idea who or what or where I am
Something good comes with the bad
A song's never just sad
There's hope, there's a silver lining
Show me my silver lining
Show me my silver lining

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road

I won't take the easy road
The easy road, the easy road

I won't take the easy road
The easy road, the easy road

Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on"
1089,Shawn Mendes,The Weight,"I wanna go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black
When you left me alone
I never knew
She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore no

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore
Yeah yeah

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight
No  I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
Can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
and I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him

But I don't want to wait"
1090,Shawn Mendes,Aftertaste,"Remember that one Friday night never forget it
How you let me go
No more lies I'll be fine I know where I'm headed
Probably should've known

Now you're gonna say pretty please forgive me
Told you once told you twice your gonna regret it
Now you're all alone yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me 
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

Close your eyes you get high
Try to forget me but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you regretted
When you left me there

Now you're gonna say pretty please forgive me yeah
But it hurts it gets worse you know nobody said it would be fair
Oh yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day but you can't

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me

1091,Troye Sivan,FOOLS,"I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and airplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

Oh, our lives don't collide, I'm aware of this
The differences and impulses and your obsession
The little things you like, stick, not like carousel
Don't give a fuck, not giving up, I still want it all

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

1092,Shawn Mendes,This Is What It Takes,"I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And am I the one you're dreaming of?

'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh, if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm trying to do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams, yeah

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh, if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

'Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh, and if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls,
These walls that are in our way

1093,Shawn Mendes,A Little Too Much,"She would not show that she was afraid,
But being and feeling alone was too much to face,
Though everyone said that she was so strong,
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on,

But she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much,

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and we'll be alright

And she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah.

A little too much, I said a little too much, oh.

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah!

Tell me that you want me
And I'll be your completely
For better or for worse

I know
We'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason
I wouldn't change it for the world

'Cause I know
The first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you
Let you slip away

And I
Still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to
Get you here today

'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's why I know you are the one
That's how I know you are the one

In life
It's easy to get scared oh
But with you I am prepared for
What has yet to come

'Cause our two
Hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces
Together making life

'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's why I know you are the one
That's how I know you are the one

When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable
Whoa
You know I never ever believed in love, I believed one day you were gonna come along

Free me

Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
I always will

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
The less I give, the more I get back
Ooh, your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice, but I still choose you

Ooh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will

1097,Shawn Mendes,One Of Those Nights,"Time warp in the middle of a daydream
Call you up ‘cause the time needs wasting
Let’s drive we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don’t stumble
We can’t do this alone

Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back, it’s now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full,
One of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours,
One of those nights

We’re young, living with no fear
Kids running wild, girls crying drunk tears
We don’t have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh we missed the last train
It’s our time and we’re leaving home

Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back, it’s now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full,
One of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours,
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t want to miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t want to miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

Go home it’s over, but it’s not the end
Don’t wait ‘til you're older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence

Where do we go? We don’t know

One of those nights, we’re driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t want to miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full,
One of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours,
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And it’s only us now,
One of those nights"

Saw you out loud honey in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

I been getting used to waking up with you
I been getting used to waking up here
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Since we met I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away but I still feel you
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are
Late at night when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you counting sheep
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Now listen here she said
Boy when you know you'll know
And I know

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood

1101,Jaymes Young,I'll Be Good,"I thought I saw the devil, this morning
Looking in the mirror, drop of rum on my tongue
With the warning to help me see myself clearer
I never meant to start a fire
I never meant to make you bleed
I'll be a better man today

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times that I never could

My past has tasted bitter for years now
So I wield an iron fist, grace is just a weakness
Or so I've been told
I've been cold, I've been merciless
But the blood on my hands scares me to death
Maybe I'm waking up today

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
I'll be good, I'll be good

For all of the light that I shut out
For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done all these years, no
Yeah, for all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times I never could
For all of the times I never could
For all of the times I never could"
1102,James Bay,Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

It used to be enough
To have you around me
Before they said too much
Now you can't be around me
'Cause now you find it hard
Not to drop your guard
Oh, not to drop your guard

I'm breaking in to steal it all
And I'll escape with every stolen moment
That I spent with you
Call me a thief, girl, if you want
But piece by piece, I'll take each stolen moment

There's no way to defend
When you pull all the walls down
It's harder to pretend
That I don't want it all now
I need it even more
Every time you go
I, I hate to watch you go

I'm breaking in to steal it all
And I'll escape with every stolen moment
That I spent with you
Call me a thief, girl, if you want
But piece by piece, I'll take each stolen moment
That I spent with you

We're the puzzle I can't fix
A million pieces still missing
When I look at you and me
I still can't tell what this is
But it's out of my control
Love's a hole you say you don't wanna fall in
But you keep falling

I'm breaking in to steal it all
And I'll escape with every stolen moment
That I spent with you
Call me a thief, girl, if you want
But piece by piece, I'll take each stolen moment
That I spent with you
Oh, that I spent with you

1105,The Lumineers,Stubborn Love,"She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you thinks she means it this time

But I still love her, I don't really care

When we were young, oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

It's better to feel pain
Than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

And I don't blame ya dear
For running like you did, all these years
I would do the same, your best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah, can't be done

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love"
1106,Rascal Flatts,What Hurts The Most,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

How I'm breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know

Little do you know
I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the feel that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight
Little do you know
I need a little more time

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain, I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait
The love you see is right here to stay so lay your head on me
Little do you know
I know you're hurting while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drowning me
Little do you know
I'm trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I love you till the sun dies

Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain, just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid, just wait
Our love we see right here stays so lay your head on me

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain, I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait

1108,Birdy,People Help The People,"God knows what is hiding
In those weak and drunken hearts
I guess he kissed the girls and made them cry
Those hard-faced queens of misadventure

God knows what is hiding
In those weak and sunken eyes
A fiery throngs of muted angels
Giving love but getting nothing back

Oh, people help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

God knows what is hiding
In this world of little consequence
Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets

God knows what is hiding
In those weak and drunken hearts
I guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone, oh, save me

People help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

People help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

1109,Sara Bareilles,She Used To Be Mine,"It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help

She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine

And it's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person
And makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you

And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless just enough
Who'll get hurt but who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck

And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day till it finally reminds her
To fight just a little to bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine"
1110,Oh Wonder,Lose It,"Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones

Loose up we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?

Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Your name I'll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones

Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are from the start
Won't you dance with me?

Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are chasing stars
Won't you dance with me?
Won't you dance with me?

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be

1113,Hozier,Work Song,"Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love, I could barely eat

There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib

And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My baby never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me

When I was kissing on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her"

So come over now and talk me down

I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you

And I know I like to draw that line when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you
The less you need to heal
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now

So come over now and talk me down

If you don't mind
I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Grey areas
And expectations

But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you

And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you

Wide door open for me

I walk myself clean through 70 dreams,
We broke like a paper seam.
But when it breaks don't cry,
I'll always hold some place for you.

I'm over you, get under me
This is the last time,
Don't say it's the last time.
Call me up -
You've got me choking up.
If we're in love,
Tonight we can getaway

Too soon, I'll wait, they say
""Boy you should know,
This will never work out""

But you say ""you're my best friend
- Boy you should know -
What if forever works out?""
""Then if it works let's try?
I'll always hold some place for you""

1122,Ryan Adams,Oh My Sweet Carolina,"I went down to Houston and I stopped in San Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
I was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust

So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane

Oh, my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go
Oh, my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

I ain't never been to Vegas but I gambled up my life
Building newsprint boats I race to sewer mains
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Funny how they say that somethings never change

Oh, my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go
Oh, my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

Up here in the city feels like things are closing in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south

Oh, my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go
Oh, my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

May you one day carry me home"

So tell me why you still get burnt
You say you're not but you're still a liar

When you show up every night
And tell me that you want me but it's complicated
So complicated

When it hurts but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?

Your love is like
Your love is like
It hurts so good
Your love is like
It hurts so good

Everytime that I swear it's over
It makes you want me even more
You pull away and I come in closer
And all we ever stay is torn

Baby I don't know why I try to deny it
When you show up every night
I tell you that I want you but it's complicated
So complicated

When it hurts but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?

Your love is like
Your love is like
It hurts so good
Your love is like
It hurts so good

Wide awake through the daylight
Will you hold me like we're running a yellow light
Reach for you with my hands tied
Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise

When it hurts but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?

Your love is like
It hurts so good
Your love is like

Feels this way for me

Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
1149,Logic,44 Bars,"If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight

You no hear me yet?
Hear me live and direct
Walk with your tap

Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
Cause shit is different now
It's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets
Y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare - I just don't go outside
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday
With a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt
We call that champagne

Come some more into my sight..."

God will lead you far
My son, I'm blessing you this morning
God will lead you far, okay?
Just put your trust and hope and everything in him
And he will take care of everything, okay?

Your son did good mum
Swear down man, your son did good mum
Know I used to run around with a budge mum
But I promise I was doing what I could mum
Now I made a little change, now we're good mum
I was saying I was gonna get you out the hood mum
Take a selfie, show 'em how you look mum
Flex on 'em, let 'em know that we're good mum
See, back then I was bumping cabs
South of the Thames, where I come from's mad
Done some dirt and I ain't too proud that you're living on the road that your son got stabbed
I had you on the station, your son got nabbed
Tough luck, just mums no dads
And we all know growing up in London's mad
Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags

Be right here whenever you need me, I need you to know that your son's got your back
Like, mum I owe you everything, can you believe that?
Everything, I'ma repeat that
And when I make a song, you give me feedback
I watched you plant the seed and then you reap that
Made a little money from cheese, I let you keep that
Hid drugs but you probably couldn't see that
Young thug, missing colly like an eediot
Fucked up saying sorry like I'm three stacks
Man I just hope you can play this
All them times that you worked on a late shift
Just to see you come short on your payslip
Always in and out of beef with the bailiffs
Now I'm on the playlist
Yeah, where I come from's bad
Same old shit, just mums, no dads
And we all know growing up in London's mad
Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad
Yeah, I bought mumzy a pad
Yeah, like mumzy you're bad

'Cause mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like 'Mum, buy a hundred bags'
Be right here whenever you need me, I need you to know that your son's got your back, look

Mum, I save it all for you
Listen to the words I say
No more broken promises
I promise this
So I save it all for you
Mum I save it all for you
Listen to the words I say
No more broken promises
No more broken promises, I swear
No more broken promises, I swear
No more broken promises, I swear

No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies
Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
Life is too short, trying to hold it all together
It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better
It's whatever, I just hope that you remember
Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as big sweater
She said, ""You're always gone.""
I said, ""'The fuck do you expect from me?""
Then she look at me and she said to me

I, I, I, I, I want to love you

Caught me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime

But temptation's always pushing people to the brink
Fuck, I always lose my judgement when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out
I try to talk it out but this is all she speak about

Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me
Lets let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!

You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew

That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven

But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up

It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air Tonight""?

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
Damn..."

1167,Lil Wayne,How To Love,"Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

Ooh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love"
1168,Eminem;Sia,Beautiful Pain,"I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today's a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
And right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, cause

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya, your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal, and hit the corner fast, the more asserted, never looking back, may hit the curb, but everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to, to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage, 'cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass, and threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes, and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline, and while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleek and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keeping you from leaping off the motherfreaking deep end
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and flame retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
'Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's gone down in flames
Throw the match at the past up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the lightt

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight
Now it feels with these wings that I will fly

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light"
1169,Eminem,Space Bound,"We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes

Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over

I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleading, I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick

Ain't no possible reason I could think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you"
1170,Eminem,When I'm Gone,"Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back"
1171,Big Sean;Kanye West;John Legend,One Man Can Change The World,"They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?

They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own

And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing

That one man could change the world

My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing

You at war with love, yeah

Guy Sebastian:
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me

But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone

With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away

Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

Lupe Fiasco:
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""Medic!""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses

Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

They ain't never gonna change

I've never felt so alive, yeah

Young Moll-ah baby!"
1173,Eminem,Mockingbird,"Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"
1174,Drake,Look What You've Done,"It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father -- my one button, you push it
Now it's ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son -- man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked from me to you, got from me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it

(Drake's Grandmother)
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help
In keeping me in this, in this comfortably
All I can say Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feelings about that
So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you..."
1175,Drake,Marvins Room,"Hello? Yeah I just walked in.
Yeah I'm good... you still working?
Tonight, right now? Did I go out? Yeah I went out.
I went... I went to a couple of clubs.
I never went to bed, shit... wine or water?
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that imma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry.""

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said ""You niggas crazy.""
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble"

But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?

We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just is as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catchin' up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night I'm supposed to lose
Just 'cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

You can give up like they tell you
Stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
But I'm tryna tell you, fuck what they tell you

And in these dark times
As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It's important to know we're not blind
We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
I would rather die on my feet than live my knees
If I can't live free right now in the world we just need (A little more love)

A little more love
A little more love"
1180,Eminem,Lose Yourself - Soundtrack Version,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
 
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man."

They tell me to quit, don't listen to what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check"

And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that
I've done things that haven't occurred yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know

That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there

Because I'm in the streets like everyday
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there's some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me (4x)
Said you can put the blame on me (3x)
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just trying to stay busy until you heard from dad

When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree

He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief

I'm sorry that I grew up way to fast
I wish I would of listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

I understand that there's some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me

Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
But they were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani

I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
And for the embarrassment that she felt
She's just a little young girl trying to have fun
But daddy should have never let her out that young

I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say

Why doesn't anybody want to take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me

And you can put that blame on me

And you can put that blame on me"

And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, that fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart won't
Just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off

Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

(Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica)"
1190,Eminem;Sia,Guts Over Fear,"Eminem
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ""Hi! My Name Is"" dropped
Started thinkin' my name was Fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on

The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it

It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on

And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet, and your only outfit
So you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it, quick and make it, ah

Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to...

Sia
I was a-afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way ou-ou-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round

An angry man's power will shut you up
Tripwires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear  (The time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around, I let you keep me down
(But now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear

Eminem
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
Did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off

And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park?

And the window is closin' and there's nowhere else that I can go
With flows and I'm frozen
'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make ""Not Afraid 2""
Than make another motherfuckin' ""We Made You"", uh

And I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all

How dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you Ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to 'cause Shady-mania
So when they empty that stadium
'Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done

So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just gettin' accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt
And eat their fuckin' faces off

The legend of the angry blonde lives on
Through you when I'm gone
And to think I was a

Sia
I was a-afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way ou-ou-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round

An angry man's power will shut you up
Tripwires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear  (The time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around, I let you keep me down
(But now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear"

Last night I sent a message
Drunk when I sent it, pieces of a fragments a sentence
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And cross the line just saying if you're down
Let's chill and get a drink
I sip, hoping I would hear again
The text bubble popped up and disappeared again
Like I don't want it getting weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
Sometimes I wonder if you share my sentiments maybe
Let me know

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)
How you feel (how you feel)
And though you were my first time
A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not if my spirit keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Till it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)

1200,Kanye West,Real Friends,"Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good"" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him

1202,Eminem;Gwen Stefani,Kings Never Die,"Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
'Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
Think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
Some want a champion to fall
I still wonder why I laugh at 'em, 'cause why care when I'm awesome?
Fuck what these cynics say
Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up
With this pent up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm coming to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I'm not stopping till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain't the same feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'mma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time

You keep the sunshine, save me the rain

I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times, seems further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb

The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga, it be on mo'fucker
'Cause all this bullshit, done made me strong mo'fucker

And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone)

I know what, they don't wanna tell you
Just hope your heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I woke up in the world, and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain, they can't wipe off (Uh)

My word is my pride, but wisdom is bleak
And that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murder and bribe
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside

It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you can see, just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all

Man it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Uhp, it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin' boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes, I stole that fuckin' clock I took the time and I

Came up from behind, and pretty much snuck up and butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another, I'ma make these fucking haters believe it

I swear to God won't spare the rod, I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch, and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie, permanently bitch it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die

My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk you're trapped in my medicine ball
I can run circles around you so fast, your fuckin' head'll spin dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'

And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed

Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

Lil Wayne
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em

Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

Eminem
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now

You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't

And I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh

Eminem
Bitch you get no (No love)

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)

That's right (You don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)

1205,Eminem,Not Afraid,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)
Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road"

No such thing

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level 'cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons 'cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

1220,Immortal Technique,Dance With the Devil,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was making a million
Being the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once, and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities at other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble minded young man with infinite potetial
The product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed


Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot


So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
He'd get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit, up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die
Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him, before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men, up in the cife
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot


They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming 'shut the fuck up' and 'stop moving around'
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed to the clouds
So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
A broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head


I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back


Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause god wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black, color is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of god's children and fall from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever"

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

For real shawty
Yeah I know

Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
I'ma fuck you over, wanna fuck you over then again the truth
'Cause I ain't really here to start problems
Girl I swear to God though, hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em ""Don't try him""
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise him
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and fourth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass on my grip, college
Make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say wassup witchu? You got my soul"

1228,Drake;Rihanna,Take Care,"(Rihanna)
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

(Drake)
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change it, I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show

When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

(Rihanna)
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost

(Drake)
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends, when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do

One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

(Rihanna)
I know you've been hurt
By someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost"
1229,Eminem,Beautiful,"Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So)"

Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas
Now back to the album

Dr. TC:
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC
And um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions, today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself
Well look, if you don't talk, I mean these sessions are going to go slower

Tyler, The Creator:
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought, this food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it
I used to be bullied for honor classes by those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught
Go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal
Play this shit in church

Tyler, The Creator and Dr. TC:
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry), no bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys

Tyler, The Creator:
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch eleven
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created OF 'cause I feel we're more talented
Than forty year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve 'em
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
'Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy
I'm bad for you kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it

Dr. TC:
Well, um, it seems you had a lot to say
And uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

Tyler, The Creator:
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mama will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Dr. TC:
Wow, um, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?"

1234,Futuristic,Music Saved My Life,"As a child I would dream about it
Sometimes it wake me from my sleep and I would think about it
Making music was all that could keep me off these streets
I don't know where I'd actually be without it, but think about it
I dedicated like twenty years to the goal
I still ain't made a name for myself and it's getting old
How many more words can I enter into this phone
Without running out of topics and dropping interesting quotes
I know people around the globe is wishing that they had a chance
To get they hands on that advance that I just passed up
Hit the road and have at least two-hundred people at every show
Smoking until I choke, that sounds mad fun
And being able to pay my bills is a plus
But money I be spending for promos is twice as much
Not to mention if you get in to the club with all these other rappers then you gotta have the nicest stuff
So fuck it, man, I'm drinking 'til I'm blacking out
They know me around the city for acting out
My dad visited for the weekend, he got a taste
And left a day early, hit me with a text, ""what's that about?""
I told him, ""it's okay, it's not a problem""
But everyone around me seem to think that I can't stop it
But yet they always wanna go out on my tab, they jobless
And they looking for a way to get it popping
So I got them, I start chilling with my old friends
They all married with good careers
Envious of what I'm doing
But only if they knew
I would trade them for a second and be outta here
But I'm too addicted to this music
And I got eight siblings that I never see
In a room I never leave
Stuck on my computer watching other niggas catch some speed
All they songs is extra weak, confusion steady stressing me
Running out of patience, let the journey get the best of me
Thought I had the recipe, so I followed every step
Left my girl and moved away, I know she happy I left
Lil bro is all alone, mama need a bigger check
All my niggas falling off, I'm still tryna be the best
Locked myself inside this booth, started making hella tracks
Cry myself to sleep at night, swear I been to hell and back
Loaded up that gun I bought, withdrew everything I had
Put it all in envelopes, had it sitting in my hand
Wrote my mama letter, and apologized for suicide
I been on a mission that they talk about but few will try
Had my finger on the trigger, would have left it all behind
And lyrics popped into my head, maybe music saved my life
Maybe music saved my life
Maybe music saved my life
Maybe music saved my life
Yeah, maybe music saved my life"

Like to believe you are
Thinking of me
And when the sun comes
Through your window I
Like to believe you've been
Dreaming of me

Dreaming, mmm

I know
'Cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in
I should know
'Cause I'd spend
Oh the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew I
Liked the affect that you
Had on my eyes
But no one else heard
The way of your words
Or felt the affect that they
Have on my mind

Falling, mmm

This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And when I leave this island
I book myself into a soul asylum
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
You're half the world away

And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And if I can leave this spirit
I'll find me a home and I'll live in it
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway

1245,Daughter,Youth,"Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line

And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

We are the reckless
We are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there

And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this

And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it

Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
A lifeless face that you'll soon forget
My eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest

And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it"

Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world

Mad world
Enlarging your world
Mad world"
1247,Birdy,Not About Angels,"We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to toss this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

How unfair, it's just our love
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up

'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special

It's not about not about angels, angels"
1248,Sia,Breathe Me,"Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me"
1249,Ed Sheeran,Even My Dad Does Sometimes,"It's all right to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's all right to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

It's all right to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It's all right to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path
And hold on"
1250,Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"

1252,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"
1253,Jeff Buckley,Hallelujah,"Well, I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?

Well, it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah"

1256,Ariana Grande;Big Sean,Best Mistake,"Ariana Grande:
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left,
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

Big Sean:
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

Ariana:
Break up, make up, total waste of time;

1257,Twenty One Pilots,Car Radio,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me
Of who I killed
Inside my dream
I hate this car
That I'm driving
There's no hiding for me

I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence


I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence


And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence"

1259,Justin Bieber,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

1264,Tom Odell,Long Way Down,"Walking on the rooftops
Talking of times
With our eyes a glowing
Like the city lights
She stands on the ledge,
She says, ""It looks so high""

You know it's a

Long way down
Feels like a long way down
Feels like a long way down
Like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave
Please don't leave me now

'Cause I can feel the rivers
Winding through the lands
Two lines, and a poet
Like a kind old rye
You know we could talk in that language
Only we understand

But you know

It's a long way down
You know it's a long way down
Feels like a long way down
Love it feels like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave
Please don't leave me now"

In these arms
In his arms
Crystal light fail me now
You're the god and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn meets the light

Heaven must to know
Heaven must to lay out stardust in my eyes
Shine my light, close to hurt in my eyes
See me now? is never mind
Angel line fail right now
You're the god and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn meets the light

And it kills me every time
And it's stolen in front my eyes
Yeah, it kills me every time,
Every story for hard time

You're the god and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn
You're the god and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn!

1266,Kodaline,All I Want,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

Ooh

If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body

1267,Jamie Lawson,Wasn't Expecting That,"It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that

Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that

Did I misread the sign?
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that

You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said,
""Well, I wasn't expecting that""

I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?

I wasn't expecting that
It was only a word
It was almost misheard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that

I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed

If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
And I wasn't expecting that
And when the nurses they came
Said its come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"
1268,James Bay,Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"
1269,Tom Odell,Another Love,"I want to take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils, on a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I want to kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I want to cry and I want to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love another love
All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart
And I want to cry, I want to learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart

You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh-hoo, ooohooo

I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there

Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, oh

Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back

Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohoho

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Ohoho, it's dangerous, it's so out of line
To try to turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you"

And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known

Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself anymore

Making love was just for fun

1273,Samantha Barks,On My Own,"On my own, pretending he's beside me
All alone, I walk with him till morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way, I close my eyes, and he has found me

In the rain, the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever 

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say, there's a way for us 

I love him, but when the night is over
He is gone, the river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare, and everywhere, the streets are full of strangers

I love him, but everyday I'm learning
Oh, my life, I've only been pretending
Without me, his world will go on turning
A world that's full of happiness that I have never known
I love him, I love him, I love him, but only of my own
But only of my own"

Voilà le portrait sans retouches
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose
Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause
C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui, dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré, pour la vie
Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi,
Mon cœur qui bat

Des nuits d'amour à plus finir
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place
Les ennuis, les chagrins s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose
Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause
C'est toi pour moi, moi pour toi, dans la vie
Tu me l'as dit, l'as juré, pour la vie
Et dès que je t'aperçois

It's funny when you think it's gonna work out
'Til ya chose weed over me, you're so lame

I thought you were cool until the point
Up until the point 
You didn't call me
When you said you would
Finally figured out you're all the same
Always coming up with some kind of story

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh,
You can't
You're too tough
You think you're loveless
Is that too much that I'm asking for?

Thought you'd come around when I ignored you
Sorta thought you'd have the decency to change
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
'Cause I'm not about, to look at your face again

Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

But every time I try to make you smile
You always go on feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You stand like a stone
Alone in your zone
Is that too much that I'm askin' for?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't find where I am
Lying here
Alone in fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim
Alone again

1277,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah..."
1288,Adele,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"

Meditate, hypnotized.

Anything to take from your mind.
But it won't, oh oh
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
Oh oh,
You're going through six degrees of separation.

You hit the drink, you take a toke
Watch the past go up in smoke.
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that,
You're better now than ever, and your life's okay
When it's not. No.

You're doing all these things out of desperation,
Oh oh,
You're going through six degrees of separation.

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little

(Oh no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)
(No no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)

You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too,
Anyone who'll throw an arm around you, yeah
Tarot cards
Gems and stones,
Believing all that shit is gonna heal your soul.
Well it's not, no

You're only doing things out of desperation,
Oh oh,
You're goin' through six degrees of separation.

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little

No there's no starting over,
Without finding closure, you take them back,
No hesitation,
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

No there's no starting over,
Without finding closure, You take them back,
No hesitation,
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

1290,Sticky Fingers,These Girls,"When I'm lying in her arms, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
Even when she smiles, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
Even when I look discretely down into her eyes,
You know I'm thinking about that time I spent between your thighs,
Even then I wondered deeply through your glances,
This girl will never care.

When I'm lying in her arms, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
And even when she cries, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
Even though I only see you on the TV screen
With all those boys and your toys,
And your pleasured scream
I'll easy spend up all this loving for my dream girl
I don't want to share.

When I'm lying in her arms, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
And even when it's wild, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
I'm in love with that girl on page 16, centerfold in that old paper magazine,
Even when under these circumstances, her curves don't compare.
I'll be thinking about you, I'll be thinking about you.
When I'm lying in her arms, I'll be thinking 'bout you,
I'll be thinking 'bout you babe, I'll be thinking 'bout you babe.
When you're with that other guy, I hope your thinking 'bout me, I hope your thinking 'bout me babe,
'Cause I'm thinking about you."

You're the only one

But up till now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And yes there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say

To spread my wings and fly away
Away without you

1293,James Blunt,Goodbye My Lover,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

1294,James Blunt,You're Beautiful,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"
1295,Amy Winehouse,Love Is A Losing Game,"For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the Gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game"
1296,Bruno Mars,When I Was Your Man,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"
1297,Christina Perri,A Thousand Years,"Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave, how can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone, all of my doubt suddenly goes away
Somehow, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
Standing in front of me, every breath
Every hour has come to this, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more, one step closer, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you

1298,Snow Patrol,Chasing Cars,"We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
1299,The Cinematic Orchestra,To Build A Home (feat. Patrick Watson),"There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home

And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees

By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust"

Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah

You come anytime you want, yeah

I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

Got a handle on the doors we open and shut

Packing up my suitcase, 'cause I'm going far away
I'm going to a place where the credit cards
Don't decline on me, yes we finally
Got a handle on the doors we open and shut

She took her time
Took my mind
But forget mine
Me in my frame of mind
We took our time
But she took mine

We're remotely secluded in this far away place
Heading to a land where everything is okay
Don't think suddenly that you and me
Got a handle on the doors we open and shut

Can you take a little time ego balance your ways
Cause everything we do and put it on display
Maybe you and me are a little the same
So what do you think of what we've made?

She took her time

When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy"

Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

1308,Calum Scott,Dancing On My Own,"Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around

Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it all my, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no

So far away but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh no
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

So far away, but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies

1309,The Who,Behind Blue Eyes,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes"
1310,Ruth B.,Superficial Love,"You're really cute, I must admit
But I need something deeper than this
I wanna know when I'm looking at you
That you don't only see the things you want to

'Cause I'm not perfect, I'm flawed
And if you don't like that, get lost
'Cause I don't want it if it's fake
I don't want it if it's just for show, for show
I just want it if it's real and I'm thinking I should let you know, you know

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
This superficial love

Fun at first, I won't deny
But I want more than just what meets the eye
I wanna know when you're looking at me
That you see deep into my personality

'Cause I want authentic, not just for fun
If this love is plastic, it'll break on us
'Cause I don't want it if it's fake
I don't want it if it's just for show
I just want it if it's real and I'm thinking I should let you know

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
This superficial love

I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
And this ain't right

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby, if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress

Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh, take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, oh, for I, I can't help
Falling in love with you"
1312,The Velvet Underground;Nico,Sunday Morning,"Sunday morning brings the dawn in
It's just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's just the wasted years so close behind

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want to know
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's all the streets you crossed not so long ago

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning

1313,The Velvet Underground,Pale Blue Eyes,"Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes


Skip a life completely, stuff it in a cup
She said, money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes"

1317,The Fray,You Found Me,"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?"
1318,Gotye;Kimbra,Somebody That I Used To Know,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody"

(*Ring, ring*)

Hello?
Aw shit, nigga.
What the fuck time is it, man?
Oh, god damn.
Nigga do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You all right?
Aw, nigga what the fuck is wrong wit you?


When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies

God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (Uh, you talkin' that crazy shit now, nigga)

All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Get a hold of yourself, nigga.)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of them (Naw, nigga, not you.)
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit

And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red (Yo, it's too late for this shit, man.)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't believe (I'm on my way over there, man.)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I want to leave

I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand (Nigga, talk to me please, man.)

You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Yo, man, I'ma call you when I get in the car.)
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet (Hey, yo...)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Hey, yo, where your girl at, man?)

My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga.)
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on (Hey, yo, are you listenin' to me motherfucker?)
I reached my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Hey, yo, come on, nigga...)

I'm sick of niggas lyin' (...cut that...)
I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Hey, yo... yo yo, Big... Hey, yo, chill!)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

1321,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1322,Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go"

For I'm broken down
Coming down this time
For my heart lies
Far and away where they took you down
Let them over to your house
Where I'm broken.

Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats, for you
Have become, all I love,
And all I hoped for.
But I, must carry on
Always one

Never broken
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Where Sophie's down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll leave them over to your eyes.
Woah, I am one,
I am one.

Great story of
Peace and love,
In a future
Bright, sacrifice,
Came around, never broken.

Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see,
Traveling a street that I did not go,
Leaves like ton to the winter load.

Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
I'll leave them over to your eyes,
Woah, I am one,
Woah, I am one,
I am one."
1326,Ellie Goulding,Your Song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"

1328,Kodaline,High Hopes,"Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy

I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
But I've only got myself to blame for it, and I accept it now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy

But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, oh, when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts of all the people who have come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
And I do believe

Believe I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, oh, when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning
And the world keeps spinning around

High hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, oh,
And the world keeps spinning
Ooh, yeah this world keeps spinning

How this world keeps spinning around"
1329,Jake Bugg,Simple As This,"I've been in search of stones
Making up the pavement of less travelled roads
Mining for treasure deep in my bones
That I never found

Went looking for reverence
Tried to find it in a bottle
And came back again
High on a hashpipe of good intent
But it only brought me down

Tried institutions of the mind and soul
It only taught me what I should not know
Oh and the answer well who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this
Something as simple as this

Travelled to each oceans end
Saw all seven wonders, trying to make some sense
Memorised the mantra Confucius said
But it only let me down

Tried absolution of the mind and soul
It only led me where I should not go
Oh and the answer well how could I miss
Something as simple as this?
Something as simple as this

I been falling crashing breaking
All the while you were stood here waiting
For me girl

Tried liberation of my own free will
But it left me looking to get higher still
Oh and the answer well who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this?
God knows how I could of missed
Something as simple as this"

I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need something to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
'Cause this could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?

1340,Green Day,Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still-frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life"
1341,Billie Eilish,ocean eyes,"I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

The finishing time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the corner
But I won't give up
Although I've stopped too

Before the end of me and you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchanged

Interpret the rooms
My tears in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
The ink is still drying
I told you the truth
And now I sigh too

The page turns on me and you
Across that white plain
The land is unchanged"

So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend

You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
And there ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

You say your faith is shaken
And you may be mistaken
To keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah?
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah?
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah?
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah?

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
To bring you to me
I can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you"

And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no

Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on (no, no, no, no, no)
Hold on, hold on (ahh)
Hold on, hold on (no, no, no, no, no)
Everybody hurts (no, no, no, no, no)

1361,Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, ""Hallelujah
You're home"""
1362,Daniel Powter,Bad Day,"Where is the moment when we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day

Flame on burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul

Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down I'll be around
With my undying death-defying love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling like flowers and pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushing in, rushing inside of me, hmm

Cleaning my soul
Flame on burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul

Lovers entwined, define divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure, the only treasure

Why everything's the same as it was

And he just happened to come at the right time

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all

Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?

That it was her heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow he could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, that don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somehow they could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know"

Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold back
Feeling like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
Talking to myself in public
And dodging glances on the train

And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Hell, they're takin' me away

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Yeah, how I used to be
How I used to be, yeah
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
(Just a little unwell)
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell
(Just a little unwell)"

1379,Beyoncé,Halo,"Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I need your halo (halo) halo
I need your halo (halo) halo
I need your halo (halo) halo
I needyour halo (halo) halo
Whoa

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo

1380,Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
1381,Harry Chapin,Cats In The Cradle,"Child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, Dad?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then""

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today
I got a lot to do"" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
Said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, Dad?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then""

I've long since retired,my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then, Dad
We're gonna have a good time then"""
1382,Lana Del Rey,Old Money,"Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
The kids were young and pretty

Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

And if you call I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind I'll come, come, come

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty"
1383,Regina Spektor,Samson,"You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go

Your hair was long when we first met

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed

And the history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light

Your hair was long when we first met

Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
He told me I was beautiful
And came into my bed

Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me till the morning light

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed

Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first"

Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

I'll wait for you, babe
It's all I do, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

I'll wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Don't say you need me when
You're leaving, you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You're leaving us, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry"

1389,Lorde,Liability,"One, two

Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun"

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

1397,Alessia Cara,River Of Tears,"Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had
I can't pretend that I don't miss you
Every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears"

Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringing me down

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

1401,Gotye;Kimbra,Somebody That I Used To Know,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know

They say you never miss it 'til it's gone
Well you're gone and I wish I'd done it better
Mostly I miss having you close to me
The only one who really ever knows me
And I'm sorry, I promise I'll do better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

Some nights, I kid myself I treated you right
Lying to myself, I didn't know
If I'm honest, I could've done it better
You said we had it pretty much perfect
And then you told me that you loved me
But you're sorry, you needed something better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

So I guess I'm gonna let you go
But you get to keep a little bit of my soul
So I guess I'm gonna write you out
But I don't think I can do it to me right now
Let's pretend that time heals all

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
But I'm not afraid to start again
Start again, gonna start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends
But I've gotta try to start again"

I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me"
1404,Shawn Mendes,Stitches,"I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head

Left me crashing in a blazing fall

Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win

1410,5 Seconds of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never sleep away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
B-by m-me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got him mirrored
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

This is the web, web that you weave

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it
Till they have a cat scan on your mind and it's nothin' but me (on it, on it...)
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, or quit it
'Cause this here's a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shh

1413,Ed Sheeran,Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

Now I'm paralyzed still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed, still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, now I'm at a payphone

Wiz Khalifa:
Man, fuck that shit, I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I go away, got what you was looking for, now It's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

Maroon 5:
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
And one more fucking love song I'll be sick, now I'm at a payphone"
1417,Adam Lambert,Ghost Town,"Died last night in my dreams 
Walking the streets 
Of some old ghost town 
I tried to believe 
In God and James Dean 
But Hollywood sold out 

Saw all of the saints 
Lock up the gates 
I could not enter 
Walked into the flames 
Called out your name 
But there was no answer 

And now I know my heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 

Died last night in my dreams 
All the machines 
Had been disconnected 
Time was thrown at the wind 
And all of my friends 
Had been disaffected 

Now, I'm searching for trust 
In a city of rust 
A city of vampires 
Tonight, Elvis is dead 
And everyone's spread 
And love is a satire 

And now I know my heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 

There's no one left in the world 
I'm gunslingin' 
Don't give a damn if I go 
Down, down, down 
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing 
Oh, my heart is a ghost town 

My heart is a ghost town 
Oh, my heart is a ghost town 
(Said, my heart) 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town"
1418,Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go"

And you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven and put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips

Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

1420,Train,Drive By,"We should be sorry you're the one who left. Listen, I'm gonna be late for work. Bye.
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

1421,Adele,Hello,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart

Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside

To tell you I'm sorry

1422,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1423,Melanie Martinez,Pity Party,"Did my invitations disappear
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better

Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
But told them decorations were in pastel ribbons

Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm dying, I'm dying
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

1424,Guy Sebastian;Lupe Fiasco,Battle Scars,"Lupe Fiasco:
Hope the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah

Guy Sebastian:
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me

But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone

With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""Medic!""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses

Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

'Cause you've set me on fire
I've never felt so alive, yeah

Lupe Fiasco:
Now hope wounds heal but it never does
That's because you at war with love

Guy Sebastian:
And I'm at the point of breaking
And it's impossible to shake it

Lupe Fiasco:
See, you hoped the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
Hope it heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love

Guy Sebastian:
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

1426,Bruno Mars,When I Was Your Man,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love

Pour a little salt, we were never here

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll gives my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood

You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing
This ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you

Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
I give you all of me, yeah
And you give me all of you, oh"
1433,Jason Mraz,I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
1434,Kelly Clarkson,Because of You,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"
1435,Bruno Mars,It Will Rain,"If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have, we don't have it anymore

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, ohohoho
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
Will keep you by my side, will keep you from walkin' out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away every day it will rain, rain, rain, heyeyey

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooohooohooo, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin': ""There goes my little girl walkin' with that troublesome guy""

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away every day it will rain, rain, rain, heyeyey

Don't just say (Don't just say) goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't just say (Don't just say) goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away every day it will rain, rain, rain, heyeyey"
1436,Calum Scott,Dancing On My Own,"Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around

Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it all my, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

I'm right over here, why can't you see me, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no

So far away but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

1437,Miley Cyrus,When I Look At You,"Everybody needs inspiration,
Everybody needs a soul
A beautiful melody
When the night's so along

'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

Yeah when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

When I look at you I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

Yea when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need every
Breath that I breathe don't you know
You're beautiful

Yeah yeah yeah

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you

Yea yea oh oh

And you appear just like a dream
To me"
1438,Sam Smith,I'm Not The Only One,"You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know,
And I know, and I know, and I don't know
I know I'm not the only one"
1439,Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America"

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, ""Sky's the limit"", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, ""Whoa"" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me

Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

That you were just with her, and I'll still be your fool...
I'm a fool for you...

Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...

1444,Demi Lovato,Warrior,"This is a story that I have never told
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
You're a criminal
And you steal like you're a pro

All the pain and the truth, I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused, I was broken and bruised

And now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

Out of the ashes, I'm burning like a fire
You can save your apologies, you're nothing but a liar
I've got shame, I've got scars, that I will never show
I'm a survivor
In more ways than you know

'Cause all the pain and the truth, I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused, I'm not broken or bruised

'Cause now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me

There's a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
All it took was once, I'll never be the same
Now I'm taking back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
'Cause you are never gonna take the blame anyway

Now I'm a warrior, I got thicker skin

No more walkin' 'round with my head down

Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio? Oh

Hey, don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow

Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

So pour me a drink oh love
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you

1450,The Script,The Man Who Can't Be Moved,"Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying if you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a brokenhearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here.""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows.
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go.""

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving

People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl
Oh whoa
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved

I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be (oh, where on earth I could be)
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet)
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street (on the corner of the street)

(So I'm not moving) 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me

But I'm Gerald and I can always have just I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

Don't put me on display

You don't own me
Don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay

And don't tell me what to do

Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

G-Eazy
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her asking
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stand up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never fall, she ain't ever long
That when she told me she ain't ever ever ever going be on

Grace
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please"

Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have

1455,Panic! At The Disco,This Is Gospel,"This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne’er-do-wells, and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Lead away by imperfect impostors

Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Oh, the fear of falling apart
Oh, the fear, the fear of falling apart

Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart"
1456,Shawn Mendes,A Little Too Much,"She would not show that she was afraid,
But being and feeling alone was too much to face,
Though everyone said that she was so strong,
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on,

But she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much,

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and we'll be alright

And she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah.

A little too much, I said a little too much, oh.

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah!

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much."
1457,Justin Bieber,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me"
1465,Sara Bareilles,Gravity,"Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone

You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall
Jjust the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone

Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall
Just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

I live here on my knees as I 
Try to make you see that you're
Everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe though I
Can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
Keeping me down

You're on to me, on to me and all over

Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long"
1466,James Arthur,Suicide,"One, two
You ready?
Here we go

It ain't the gun
It's the man behind the trigger
Gets blood on his fingers
And runs
It ain't the lie
It's the way that the truth is denied

But if there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Please look them straight in the eye

Commit suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

It ain't the knife
It's the way that you use it
How you abuse it in fights
The angel in life
You feel you were given
As long as you're living in love

But if there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Please look them straight in the eye

Commit suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

You've been killing me softly
And finally that is too much
And I won't no longer will escape
Just don't cut the town if you've gone

If there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died

Commit suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

Oh baby
Just let them know
Just..."

And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

1470,Marc E. Bassy;G-Eazy,You & Me,"Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
Disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more
It's just you and me
We're just strangers in passing casually
It's not us no more
It's just you and me

Shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more
It's just you and me
We're just strangers in passing casually
It's not us no more
It's just you and me

Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
I know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more
It's just you and me

On a crowded street
It's not us no more"

You don't want me

I'd never ask you cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry believe me
I love you but not in that way

And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant
I'm so dependant
I'm such a fool

When you're not there
I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear
Can't face the truth

You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

I'd never ask you
Cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry

But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)

And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me

So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby

I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"

But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Would you let it go?

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you"

But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is

Standing in front of me, every breath

Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

1482,Ariana Grande,My Everything,"I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him...
To think that I was wrong;
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone...
Pain is just a consequence of love;
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us...

He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling,
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure...
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...

You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

You are, you are, you are...
You are, you are, you are... my everything..."

Follow their plan

How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you?

Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close

Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me

Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter

So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna feel so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming, hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart, art, art, art
It's California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me

Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight terror free, I will give you all of me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow
You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight terror free, I will give you all of me
Leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me"
1487,John Mayer,Still Feel Like Your Man,"I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man

The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man

Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, babe

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man"
1488,Adele,Turning Tables,"Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning, oh..."
1489,Birdy,People Help The People,"God knows what is hiding
In those weak and drunken hearts
I guess he kissed the girls and made them cry
Those hard-faced queens of misadventure

God knows what is hiding
In those weak and sunken eyes
A fiery throngs of muted angels
Giving love but getting nothing back

Oh, people help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

God knows what is hiding
In this world of little consequence
Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets

God knows what is hiding
In those weak and drunken hearts
I guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone, oh, save me

People help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool

Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
Till I can't feel my heart

And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'll do all I can
To get you out of my head

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

Yeah and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
To forget you again

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you

I got so much of my loving to give you

1499,Beyoncé,Honesty,"If you search for tenderness, it isn't hard to find;
You can have the love you need to live...
But if you look for truthfulness, you might just as well be blind -
It always seems to be so hard to give...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can always find someone to say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve...
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies;
All I want is someone to believe...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can find a lover, I can find a friend;
I can have security until the bitter end...
Anyone can comfort me with promises again, I know...

When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned;
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone...
But when I want sincerity, tell me, where else can I turn,
When you're the one that I depend upon?

-Esty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard;
Mostly what I need from you..."

But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

Yeah yeah
Do re mi fa so

Yeah
If I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound of breaking glass on my range rover
Pay me back or bitch it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'mma stay asleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya'
It go like

Do re mi fa so fucking done with you girl
So fucking done with all the games you play
I ain't no tic tac toe
Send the X and Os on another note I'm ghost
Do re mi fa so fucking done with you baby
So send the X and Os on another note I'm ghost

If I could go back to that day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up everyday and make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments, your makeup bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
Cause everybody wanted to tap that ass sometime

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya'

I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
It'd be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign, take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

I know I can treat you better
I know I can treat you better
I know I can treat you better
Promise I'll never let you down

Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart old and testified
Tell me that I'm not crazy

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs

1507,Shawn Mendes,Three Empty Words,"I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight

We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight
We're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother

It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no oh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further

Oh, we're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
I'm tired, I can't take it anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
We tired, we can't take it anymore

We going through motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken, no
And I know it's gonna hurt

From the way you talk
To the way you move

Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time

It makes me reckless

1512,Demi Lovato,Skyscraper,"Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching teardrops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
And go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear, yeah oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper, oh woah
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper"

I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along into the start of forever

And after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far

And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)

I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies

And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

1515,Kelly Clarkson,Piece by Piece,"And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
I traveled 1,500 miles to see you
Begged you to want me but you didn't want to

But piece by piece he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandon things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love it isn't free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed so I was worthless

But piece by piece he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandon things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me

(Oh, oh) Piece by piece

Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first

And you know he'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her
And piece by piece he'll restore my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

1516,Kelly Clarkson,Someone,"So this is my apology 
For saying all those shitty things
I wish I didn't really mean
I'm sorry, I'm not sorry

You had your red flags up and raised
More traffic than East L.A.
But I drove in anyway
My common sense on holiday

People fall out of phase
We were a crash course
We will just be a place
Stuck on your passport
You traveled to sometime
But I hope you will find

Someone to cry for
Someone to try for
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets
Someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be
The reason you breathe
Be the reason you breathe

You stay in love like vacation homes
You like summers on the sunny coast
But when the cold needs a winter coat
You say you will until you don't

You wore a compass around your neck
A different North than we'd ever read
Well, did you get where you're going yet?
Wish you the worst, wish you the best

I don't know how I fell into your rearview
Paralyzed lullabies, I couldn't hear you
So I hope you were right
And next to you tonight

There's someone to cry for
Someone to try for
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets
Someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be
The reason you breathe
Be the reason you breathe

So this is my apology
For saying all those shitty things
I wish I really didn't mean
Sorry I'm not sorry"

Your hands are burned from holding me

And maybe you and I will fall in time eventually
Maybe we'll both die trying but I can't bring myself to leave
'Cause I've looked

And I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains, babe just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete

You're on the tightrope
I've got my reasons
How did we get so tangled
You turn, I stay straight
I bend as you break
We're so messed up but I know

That you and I will fall in time eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains, babe just to stumble into your good grace and I

Stood with our backs to the sun
I can't remember being nothing but fearless and young
We've become echoes
But echoes fade away
We fall into the dark as we dive under the way

(I heard you say)
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can't forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger

Some silhouette
So, let's go out in flames
Swear for one knows who we are
'Cause these city walls never knew
That we'd make it this far
We've become echoes
But echoes fade away
So, let's dance like two shadows

Burning out in glory days
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can't forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger

Some silhouette
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me

Just hold me
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can't forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger
Some silhouette
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger

We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky.
With you, I'm alive
Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.
I'm just a sad song.

With you I fall.
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall.
With you I'm a beautiful mess.
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge.

So stop time right here in the moonlight,
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

You're the perfect melody,
The only harmony
I wanna hear.
You're my favorite part of me,
With you standing next to me,
I've got nothing to fear.

Without you, I feel broke.
Like I'm half of a whole.
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.
Without you, I feel torn.
Like a sail in a storm.
Without you, I'm just a sad song.

Without you, I feel broke.

1521,Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America"

When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

I'd never ask you cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry believe me
I love you but not in that way

And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant
I'm so dependant
I'm such a fool

When you're not there
I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear
Can't face the truth

You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

I'd never ask you
Cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry

1524,5 Seconds of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never sleep away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

No I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"
1525,Jason Mraz,I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
1526,Snow Patrol,Chasing Cars,"We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"

1529,Billie Eilish,ocean eyes,"I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes"
1530,Billie Eilish,watch,"Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Never let you burn
Let you burn, let you burn
Never gonna let you burn
Let you burn"

But one bitch can leave you with millions of stitches
And I don't want to say I'm that bitch but I'll never be a Mrs
I'm just going to say you'll never see me in the kitchen

Busting my ass for someone who's not there

Trust issues with trusting you
I got issues with trusting you
Trust issues with trusting you
I got issues with trusting you

I'm just letting you know I'm emotionally unavailable
I'd love to reciprocate your love but I'm incapable
I know that you don't get it, but I'm just so unstable
And all I could think about is how you'd be unfaithful
You think that I am crazy
But that, that does not phase me
And no, you cannot change me
Just know you cannot save me
You say you love me so much but I don't want your love
You say you love me so much but I don't want your love
No, no

Please don't tell me you want me

I think I think too much
Or maybe you don't think enough
But one of us is right, and one of us is wrong
And one of us is leading the other one on
And I don't want to say I wouldn't date you
And I could never say that I hate you
I mean I guess I could, but it ain't true
I swear it's me, not you

Please don't tell me you want me
Please don't say you do
Honestly, it's not you it's me

And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times 
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved 
And she will be loved

I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had
She's showing off

Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes

Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change
Me and you

Chasing it tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy

Disappearing when you wake up

Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost

Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can

All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm not young and beautiful?"

I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?"

And if I'm not the best then you're stuck
I tried to server ties and I, ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts

I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Even though I know what's wrong, how could I be so sure
If you never say what you feel, feel
I must have held your hand so tight, you didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah

You must be a miracle worker
Swearin' up and down you can fix what's been broken yeah
Please don't give my hopes up, no, no
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel

It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts

Baby I just ran out of band-aids

1544,Ariana Grande;Big Sean,Best Mistake,"Ariana Grande:
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left,
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

Big Sean:
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

Ariana:
Break up, make up, total waste of time;
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

You're, you're, you're, you're,
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

You're, you're, you're, you're,

And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth

Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)

The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now""
""Why?""
""Oh, 'cause she's dead!"" (oh)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

1557,James Arthur,Impossible,"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love 
I did
And You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy 
And my heart is broken
I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible"
1558,Taylor Swift,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say ""Never say never...""
 
...So he calls me up, and he's like, ""I still love you,"" and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together"
1559,Taylor Swift,Bad Blood,"'Cause baby now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me?
where I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last

Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts

Mmm, if you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find

1562,Taylor Swift,Blank Space,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever

1563,Taylor Swift,The Story Of Us,"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, standing out there alone
Oh, a yearning and it's real for me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love"
1573,Jamie Lawson,Wasn't Expecting That,"It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that

Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that

Did I misread the sign?
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that

You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said,
""Well, I wasn't expecting that""

I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?

I wasn't expecting that
It was only a word
It was almost misheard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that

I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed

If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
And I wasn't expecting that
And when the nurses they came
Said its come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"
1574,Ron Pope,A Drop In The Ocean,"A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Just a drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep,
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my

Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore no, no
Heaven doesn't seem far away.
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore no, no
Heaven doesn't seem far away.

Aooo
Aooo

A drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.
You are my heaven"
1575,Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, ""Hallelujah
You're home"""

1577,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"
1578,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
And for always I will say

Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"
1590,Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
1591,Beyoncé,If I Were a Boy,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy"
1592,Kesha,Praying,"Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become

'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I've been thrown out, I've been burned
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name

You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying"
1593,Coldplay,The Scientist,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start"
1594,James Blunt,You're Beautiful,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"
1595,Lady Gaga,Million Reasons,"You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey, eh, eh, ey
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, eh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay"
1596,Labrinth;Emeli Sandé,Beneath Your Beautiful,"You tell all the boys no
Makes you feel good, yeah
I know you're out of my league
But that won't scare me away, oh no

You've carried on so long
You couldn't stop if you tried it
You've built your wall so high
That no one could climb it
But I'm gonna try

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
Take it off now girl, take it off now girl
I wanna see inside
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?

You let all the girls go
Makes you feel good, don't it?
Behind your Broadway show
I heard a voice say ""Please don't hurt me""

You've carried on so long
You couldn't stop if you tried it
You've built your wall so high
That no one could climb it
But I'm gonna try

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?
Oh, tonight

See beneath, see beneath

I'm gonna climb on top your ivory tower
I'll hold your hand and then we'll jump right out

We'll be falling, falling

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
Take it off now girl, take it off now girl

1597,One Direction,Little Things,"Your hand fits in mine
Like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me

I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile
You've never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You'll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know
I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you
Oh...

I've just let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you
Oh it's you
It's you
They add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth

They add up to
I'm in love with you

Whatever's been filling your cup, no more

Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
At my front door just to say you're alone tonight

Do you hear me?
I'm blinded,
'Cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing, alone
I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around

And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
I can love you more than this

If I'm louder
Would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are, the same
You saved me, but when you leave it's gone again

And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I'm on my knees
Praying

When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this

Yeah, I've never had the words to say
But now I'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms, yeah
And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That's shining from the stars above

When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right

Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

Seems to come so natural

Feeling so out of touch
Staying inside too much
Introducing all these hands but I'm out of luck

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Is there anything you need?
Make you feel more comfortable
Put your mind at ease

So what do I do instead?
When I think about every single thing
Nodding through my head
Keeping me inside

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to

Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now

You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

Do do do, do do do

You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall

Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Do do do, do do do

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

Do do, do, do, do
Do do, do, do, do
Do do, do, do, do

You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

If we could find a reason, a reason to change

1627,Mild High Club,Tesselation,"Daddy knows just what to do
When his hand becomes a pool
In his head he ain't a fool
Pushing weight in Hollywood

My gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
Learning tricks from Uncle Donnie
And Walt for our education

Sloganeering on the lot
He's a nascent vagabond
Motion picture babylon
When I'm twisted and alone

My gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
Learning tricks from Uncle Donnie
And Walt for a revelation
And if you thought this paradigm was out of the box
This rare design is only a block in the tesselation"

1632,Mild High Club,Homage,"Someone wrote this song before
And I could tell you where it's from
The 4736251 to put my mind at ease

Please just have a laugh with me
'Cause you know I'm borrowing by now
These sounds, have already crowned
Come on it's a silly dream
Dreaming of the imagery unfound
The view sits nice from that cloud

And if you want a piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flipping
Why don't you toss?

1640,Mild High Club,Windowpane,"Leave behind
Just too delicate to
The time we had discovered it

Things; they seem different
In my mind, we were experimenting
Life
Passes on the right
Still life
Takes you for a ride

I just like to take a look for a while
It's such a pretty picture
Life
Passes on the right
Still life
Takes you for a ride"

1642,Raury,All We Need,"Don't hate my brother, God is our friend
I've walked for miles and I see no end
To the hate, oh, to the hate
And we just, sit and wait on...

Who can save the world, my friend?
Who can save the world, my friend?
Who can save the world, my friend?
All we need is love

Who's gonna save the dyin' man from his hunger?
Who's gonna take from the rich
And give to the ones who never had a chance?
Who's gonna wipe the tears?
Are we ever gonna overcome the fear?
We've got a battle

Who can save the world, my friend?
Who can save the world, my friend?
Who can save the world, my friend?
All we need is love

And now I'm just 18 in the summer
The world is hot as Hell as the devil walks up my street
And I'm out on my Georgia porch
Scorchin' the board with the pen
My hand has been forced
We're meant to be tools of God
But instead we cop us a Porsche
Temperature risin', money disguise the fact
That we need to discover love in the earth and sky and beyond
Love is what's missin', love don't live here no more
Dear America, please listen, that sound will open the door
To new reality, palpable types of fallacy
Live my life young and reckless
But keep that shit on the balance beam
What do you love? Find it, let it consume you
Deserve it after the things you've endure, I know that your pupils
Have seen Hell twisted over and backwards
Soon as we learn to speak we begin our career as actors
Always agreein' with things we're told to believe in
Time is repeatin', somebody knows what is needed"

1656,Mac Demarco,Chamber Of Reflection,"Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day
You're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run
With better men

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

No use looking out
It's within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be cleared
Among the better men

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone"

1658,King Krule,Easy Easy,"Well same old Bobby, same old beat
Well yeah they got nothing on me
The same old cars, same old streets
But yeah they got nothing on me
And easy come and easy go
Well yeah I'm sure I told you so
Well they just want you for your dough
Man I'm sure I told you so
And with your dead-end job
That's been eating away your life
You feel a little inside
The trouble and strife
And now you spend your evenings
Searching for another life
And yeah I think, mate
I think you've got them in your sights

Well, easy easy
There's no need to take that tone
Well easy
I'm on the telephone
Man just leave us alone

Ow no I should've kept my receipts
Cause the sandwich I bought
Yeah it's been off for a week
And 'low Tesco's stealing my money
When positivity seems hard to reach
I keep my head down and my mouth shut
Cause if you going through hell
We just keep going

You're easy, so easy
You're easy
Man just leave us alone
I'll be one minute on the phone"

1660,Unknown Mortal Orchestra,Multi-Love,"Multi-Love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God? Where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love
All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under
May all her minds be made up
I'll be your Vicodin, expired and escaped to Valhalla
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama what have you done to me
I'm half crazy

Multi-Love
It's not that this song's about her
All songs are about her
Sun shines underneath us
Fearing new kinds of mind control and just blaming each other
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God? Where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama what have you done to me
I'm half crazy

Multi-Love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama what have you done to me
I'm half crazy"
