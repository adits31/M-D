5,Daniel Caesar;Kali Uchis,Get You (feat. Kali Uchis),"Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you

And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you

And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, It's all just memories

(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...Feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...Feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take...

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you

This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise"

15,June Marieezy,Fly,"Fly, in the song you sing
Why you waitin'
Be the light

My three sixty degree reality
Sunset beach I don't need HD TV
I want the real thing
Living off a dream
Gimmie couple thousands I'mma jet to Philippines
My three sixty degree ability
Visioneer lose the fear let there be reason
Give circulation to the nation we are one
Everything is fun under the sun
I just tell myself to fly

Fly, in the sun you'll breath
Fly, you do not need me
Fly, in the song you sing
Why you waitin'
Be the light

My three sixty dollars on the shelf
What's my wealth
I'm the best at bein' myself
I can tell you American dreams
Nice thing from the shop
But I really think that Asia's 'bout to pop
My three sixty five days on the wall
Live each day like my last
Green like paper over plastic
Wrap my head around the whole world is a blast
If ya open up to magic
I just wanna tell you fly

Fly, in the sun you breath
Fly, you do not need me to
Fly, in the song you sing
Why you waitin'
Be the light

I will, I will rise with the tribe
I can feel your vibe from the other side (x2)

17,Daniel Caesar;H.E.R.,Best Part (feat. H.E.R.),"Oh, hey
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are
 
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh
 
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh, you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part
 
It's the sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice
 
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life
 
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part
 
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you"
18,Bruno Major,Easily,"Don't cha tell me that it wasn't meant to be.
Call it quits or call it Destiny.
Just because it won't come,
Easily
Dosn't mean we shoudn't try.
We had a good thing goin' baby,
Might not've always been a farytale.
But you know
And I know that
They
Ain't
Real
I'll take the truth over the story.
You might have tried my patients greatly,
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail.
But won't cha do somethin' for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be.
Call it quits or call it Destiny.
Just because it won't come
Easily
Dosn't mean we shoudn't try.
Comin' and goin',
Inside out
And back to front.
All tangled and messy.
And that's how
We'll feel and will
Al-ways
Be.
That's alright with me.
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be.
Call it quits or call it Destiny.
And just because it won't come
Easily
Dosn't mean we shoudn't try...
Try
Try
Just because it won't come, Easily.
Dosn't mean we shouldn't try.

Just because it won't come, Easily.
Dosn't mean we shouldn't try...
Try
Try
Just because it won't come, Easily.
Dosn't mean we shouldn't try."

You've got everything, you got what I need

Move me, take me from this place
Movin' to the tempo, show me what it takes
Speeding up my heartbeat, playing in the flames

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space

Covered in your water and I'm feeling like a summer breeze
Submitted under power and you brought me to my knees
Use me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me all the way
Whisper in my ear, I'm the only one you're loving on
Take advantage of the moment, you're the only one that I want

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space

Melting like ice on a summer day
Hold me like you mean, take me far away
Bodies moving in, temperature rising
Take me to the top then watch me fall in

Kiss me (Kiss me), we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, (we're on fire...)"

50,Ed Sheeran,Tenerife Sea,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back"
51,Haley Reinhart,Can't Help Falling in Love,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh, take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, oh, for I, I can't help
Falling in love with you"

53,Ellie Goulding,How Long Will I Love You - Bonus Track,"How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can

How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you?
As long as I live through you
However long you say

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you"
54,Coldplay,The Scientist,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start"

56,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
57,Christina Perri,A Thousand Years,"Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave, how can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone, all of my doubt suddenly goes away
Somehow, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
Standing in front of me, every breath
Every hour has come to this, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more, one step closer, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more"
58,Alicia Keys,If I Ain't Got You,"Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby"

60,Adele,Turning Tables,"Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning, oh..."

63,Ed Sheeran,Kiss Me,"Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
Hold me in your arms

Your heart's against my chest
Lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you

So hold you close
To help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love"
64,Adele,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"

66,Lily Allen,Somewhere Only We Know,"I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need something to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
'Cause this could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know"
67,Sara Bareilles,Gravity,"Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone

You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall
Jjust the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone

Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall
Just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

I live here on my knees as I 
Try to make you see that you're
Everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe though I
Can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
Keeping me down

You're on to me, on to me and all over

Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long"
68,Jason Mraz,I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
69,Jason Mraz;Colbie Caillat,Lucky,"Do you hear me? I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you I promise you I will

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday"
70,Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
71,Snow Patrol,Chasing Cars,"We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
72,Train,Marry Me,"Forever could never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now
We won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
And love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Together could never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words
I love you and you're beautiful
Now that the wait is over
And love has finally showed her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to
Sing to you
When all the music dies

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm
Marry me"

74,Jessie Ware,Say You Love Me,"Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's getting torn from your mistakes

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
Want to feel burning flames when you say my name
Want to feel passion flow into my bones
Like blood through my veins

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And, baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Slowly slowly you run for me,
But do you know me at all?
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No no no no no)
If you don't wanna try
(Just try sometimes)
But all that I've been thinking of

Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do

So, then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to've done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn it into something beautiful
D'you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do

I drew a line

76,Jason Mraz,I'm Yours,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"

Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes

Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change
Me and you

Chasing it tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby

When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams they are made up of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia-tone loving
Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions of my heart
Like why we're here? 'nd where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy,
No, Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

Mmm it's always better when we're together
Yeah we look at them stars when we're together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
And brings new things
But tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, It's always better when we're together
Mmm We're somewhere in between together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"

Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and...

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me, if we're not careful, turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and...

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?"

That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm

I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light upon the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen

I spend her love until she's broke inside (Until she's broke inside)

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
And I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realized that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, ""This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy""

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling, we just have to wait and see

Than waiting to win the lottery

Like a bird taking way
Tears that set you free
You're the sweetest thing that I ever did see
Oh yeah see oh yeah

I'll keep you close through the night

You'll be the fool this time
You'll take my place
For a little while
You'll give me a chance
You'll let me break you down
Let me use you up
You'll show me how
Oh, my love
Your pretty little wings
They must be getting tired
Trying to keep your feet
Up off the ground
Let's go back to the days beneath the Northern Lights
When we danced so free
Like a little child
Oh, my love
You thought I'd left without you
Oh, my love
My arms were always around you
 
Just say to me
You'll lie awake this time
You'll watch me sleep
Straight through the night
No more dreams
Must I sacrifice
My heart is safe
You'll guard it with your life
My love
You thought I'd left without you
But oh, my love
My arms were always around you
My arms were always around you
Oh, my love
You thought I'd left without you
But oh, my love
My arms were always around you
My arms were always around you

I'll keep stealing, breathing her
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
One of us will die inside these arms

Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our
Ashes 'round the yard

She says, ""If I leave before you, darling
Don't you waste me in the ground""
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
One of us will die inside these arms

Eyes wide open

Ashes 'round the yard"

111,Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,If We Were Vampires,"It's not the long flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong

It's not your hands, searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone or one day you'll be gone

If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
And laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand

Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard till the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone or one day you'll be gone

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone or one day you'll be gone"

I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased, our heart beats becoming slow

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, the flesh calmly going cold

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

And they'd find us in a week
We'll lay here for years or for hours
When the weather gets hot
So long, we'd become the flowers
And they'd find us in a week
We'll lay here for years or for hours
So long, we'd become the flowers
When the cattle show fear

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say

I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you"

Never turns the lights down low
She can go there if you wanna though
There are no markings on her country roads
No signs that show the way back home

I've frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her
She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I'm burning yeah I'm burning
I'm burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I'm melting darling, I can't let go
She likes to lay under the covers though
Pretending everywhere's our home
Keeps me warm right to my very soul
We get so tangled up its hard to know
What is hers and what's my own
Vines at the bottom of an olive grove
I've frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her
She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I'm burning yeah I'm burning

I don't want no one travelling around
He needs to be right here with me.

But you can't help who you love
And boy it's always been you
So now I'm here all alone
Waiting for you.

When I first met you I was just 21
And barely knew my own mind.
All I'd been told is if you find a man
To make sure he's gentle and kind.

But you can't help who you love
And boy it's always been you
So now I'm here all alone
Waiting for you.

Days come and go and months pass me by
And seasons they leave me behind.
Don't have a thought about where I'll be
I'll be here till the end of all time.
'Cause you can't help who you live
And boy it's always been you
So now I'm here all alone
Waiting for you."
121,Sarah Jarosz,Build Me Up From Bones,"Build me up from bones
Wrap me up in skin
Hold me close enough to breathe me in

The moon's a fingernail
Scratching on the back
Of the night in which we lay beside

I held every inch of you
I wrote every line for you
I made time when time was all but gone
You're the love I've always known

The night's so dark and grey
But you've helped me find my way
Through the wild and wonders of this world

So take me with you now
I need to show you how
I can love you better than before

Play it sweet and low
We've got no where to go
I am yours and you're the love I know"

There's a wild cat in you, woman
A wild cat on the prowl.
Every time I put my arms around you
I can hear that wild cat growling.

I remember when I met you
There was something about the moon
I remember when I met you
There was something about the moon
I don't remember if it was waxing or waning
But I knew you'd be leaving soon.

Beyond the perfect sky
Lay beside me cry and laugh

Stay with me for a while

Restless one your walking fast
On a golden shore
Wait for me you humble seed
My feet are red and sore

Even though you cannot speak
And life has been unkind
Keep this little tune with you
In good times and in bad

Now tell me love what I've done wrong
My hands are cold and blue
Tomorrow in another dawn
I'll sing this song for you

So find me love a wooden boat
So we can sail away
Well find ourselves a piece of earth
And in it we will stay

Even though you cannot speak
And life has been unkind
Keep this little tune with you
In good times and in

And life has been unkind
Keep this little tune with you

Like I might give in the big idea
You'd forgive me just like that

I wouldn't have it any other way
Heaven knows a sinner needs a saint
Oh but when I've been at my most ugly
I hate the way you love me

You're a hard woman to live with
I could never fill those shoes
An example for our children
I could never live up to

And I hate myself for staying
Where I should and should not be
Someone I know I don't deserve
And doesn't deserve me

I wouldn't have it any other way
Heaven knows a sinner needs a saint
Oh but when I've been at my most ugly

Lips generous and all
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I I never understood what was at stake
Never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want a trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time

Half this morning
Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in
I should know
'Cause I'd spend
Oh the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew I
Liked the affect that you
Had on my eyes
But no one else heard
The way of your words
Or felt the affect that they
Have on my mind

Falling, mmm

'Cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in

'Cause I'd spend
Oh the whole day

Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear

And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my

The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder

Going so fast, every doubt we had is coming undone
And falling behind with everything we left there
We held on for far too long

And now we pass so many people on the road
They could come along, I wish they'd been told
They may call it a shot in the dark
From what we know, it's not unheard of

And we'll one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

Our favorite parts are what we'll keep
Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories
So everything else has room to grow
'Cause in better light, everything changes

So we can one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

There's no race, there's only a runner
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race there's only a runner
1, 2, 3 even when you get tired
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race, no ending in sight
No second too short, no window too tight

Just turn off the lights when you leave
'Cause we've got everything we're gonna need
We're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run child
We gotta run, we gotta run, we gotta run child

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me

Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

All that we have to give to each other
Till forever

How you move me
How you move me to love you
I keep choosing to love you again every morning

Lover, find me underneath the covers
We will stay here until we discover
All that we have to give to each other
Till forever

Take this body, I give it all for you
Hold me, touch me, when you make your move

Let me lay here beside you
We can stay here and not say a word

Lover, find me underneath the covers
We will stay here until we discover
All that we have to give to each other
Till forever
Till forever"

158,Haley Reinhart,Can't Help Falling in Love,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh, take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, oh, for I, I can't help
Falling in love with you"

163,Scott Helman,Machine,"Your heart is more than a machine.
Pumping blood through your body, doing things you've never seen.
Their words come like arrows when they fly.
With mechanical percision they can cut you up inside.
But you're more than bolts.
Like the city's more than steel and stones.
Soon your heart is gonna overflow.
Push you back down you get up again.
Circuits freeze and androids never dream.
You're more than a machine.
Touch screen.
Figertips and pretty lights.
We go through the scanner sideways.
See you on the other side.
Your flesh.
 
All your skin and all your bones.
Carry all our generations.
With futures still unknown.
But you're more than bolts.
Like the city's more than steel and stones.
Soon your heart is gonna overflow.
Push you back down you get up again.
Circuits freeze and androids never dream.
You're more than a machine.
But you're more than bolts.
Like the city's more than steel and stones.
Soon your heart is gonna overflow.
Push you back down you get up again.
Circuits freeze and androids never dream.
You're more than a machine."

I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show

Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes, I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep totally free

Awake my soul

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes

Where you invest your love, you invest your life
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love, you invest your life

Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker

You were made to meet your maker"
167,Ed Sheeran,Give Me Love,"Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

I could have knocked off the evening
But I lonelily landed my waltz in her hands
In a way I felt you were leaving me
I was sure I wouldn't find you at home
And you let me down
Could have knocked off the evening
But you lonelily let him push under your bone
You let me down
It's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone

You're coming home (x 4)

I gave me away
I could have knocked off the evening
But I was lonelily looking for someone to hold
In a way I lost all I believed in
And I never found myself so low
And you let me down
You could've called if you'd needed
But you lonelily got yourself locked and instead
You let me down
It's one thing being cheated
But you took him all the way through your bed

And now you're coming home 
And I'm trying to forgive
You're coming home
And I'm trying to forget
You're coming home
And I'm trying to move on
You're coming home
And you haven't called yet

You're coming home
And I'm trying to forgive
You're coming home
I'm just trying to forget
You're coming home
I'm trying to move on
You're coming home
But you haven't called
You're coming home

If the song it had me overcome
The tremble low can sometimes shake me up
Would you come, to me?
Would you come, to me?

Oh...

If your heart is burning like the sun (burning like the sun)
If it means that you will have to run (you will have to run)
If it takes leaving everyone
Would you come, to me?

Would you come, to me?"

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze

And so it is

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

Baby knows how to confide in me
Something I don't know myself,

So he can run
For there's nothing left here for us.
But it's all in my head.

And in bad and stone cold weather
My love, I'll shoot for my escape
No fear, I'll piece you together
With thick and black ductape
Oh, with thick and black ductape

You're from New Orleans,
And I'm from here but
I don't know what that means.
But I'm begging you My Dear
And I'll stay strong.

So have no fear now, Honey
I'll lay low for a while
And the day when you least
Expect it, I'll appear
But it's all in my head

And I'm in bad and stone cold weather
My Love, I'll shoot for my escape.
No fear, I'll piece you together

Gives me the goodbye I need

I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
And went up on a tree

To be alone with me and went up on the tree
I've never known a man who loved me"
180,One Direction,Little Things,"Your hand fits in mine
Like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me

I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile
You've never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You'll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know
I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you
Oh...

I've just let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you
Oh it's you
It's you
They add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things

I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true

It's you

I'm in love with you

Tell me it's not to late

Now my arms are open wide
They're hanging forever there
Waiting forever for you
I won't give up on you this time
'Cause I ain't holding on, for nobody else

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to find it
It's gotta be you

I wish I could turn back the time
The power is yours and never mine
Maybe with time you'll see that
I can give you all the things you missed
Oh, no, no

Now my arms are open wide
And I ain't holding on, for nobody else

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you

Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened

Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

And you kiss me on the dance floor 
I wish that it could be like that 
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

When you're with him, do you call his name,
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

Girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we're making
I'm living for that day, someday

Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours!

Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftops
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't we be like that?
Wish we could be like that"

Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
Take it off now girl, take it off now girl
I wanna see inside
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?

In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows

We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know

So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets

So let's take our time to say what we want
Here's what we got before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted

Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

Hey
Whoa

I'm gonna love you (oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

192,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

Only yesterday we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
You tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

Someone's moving outside
The lights come on and down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don't it feel fucked up we're not in love

Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
You tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

195,The Script,"Never Seen Anything ""Quite Like You""","I think I want you more than want
And no I need you more than need
I want to hold you more than hold
When you stood in front of me
I think you know me more than know
And you see me more than see
I could die now more than die
Every time you look at me

Well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you

When it's right it's more than right
Those you feel it more than feel
I could take this moment now
Ride into the great with me

I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight

And your eyes are in your eyes
And my heart's in our hearts
Sometimes words just ain't enough
For this love that's more than love

Well I've seen you in jeans with no make-up on
And I've stood there in awe as your date for the prom
I'm blessed as a man to have seen you in white
But I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight
No, I've never seen anything quite like you tonight"

197,John Legend,All of Me,"What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in and you kicking me out?
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down

What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm outta my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll gives my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood

You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing
This ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you

Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
I give you all of me, yeah
And you give me all of you, oh"

How I'm breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memory
Little do you know
I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the feel that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight
Little do you know
I need a little more time

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain, I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait
The love you see is right here to stay so lay your head on me
Little do you know
I know you're hurting while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drowning me
Little do you know
I'm trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I love you till the sun dies

Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain, just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid, just wait
Our love we see right here stays so lay your head on me

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain, I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait
The love you see right here stays so lay your head on me

So lay your head on me

I love you till the sun dies"

201,Tom Odell,Grow Old with Me,"I can feel you breathing
With your hair on my skin
As we lie here within
The night

I'll pull those sheets
When it's cold on your feet
'Cause you'll fall back to sleep
Every time

Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I

And our hands they might age
And our bodies will change
But we'll still be the same
As we are

We'll still sing our song
When our hair ain't so blonde
And our children have sung
We were right

They'll sing
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I

And the hairs they stand up
And my feet start to thump
Yet the feeling is dreaming
Around

You'll be the one
Make me hard, make me come
Make me feel like I'm real
And alive

Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I

Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I"
202,Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him

I heard there was somone but I know he don't deserve you
If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you
I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips

209,Ruth B.,Superficial Love,"You're really cute, I must admit
But I need something deeper than this
I wanna know when I'm looking at you
That you don't only see the things you want to

'Cause I'm not perfect, I'm flawed
And if you don't like that, get lost
'Cause I don't want it if it's fake
I don't want it if it's just for show, for show
I just want it if it's real and I'm thinking I should let you know, you know

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
This superficial love

Fun at first, I won't deny
But I want more than just what meets the eye
I wanna know when you're looking at me
That you see deep into my personality

'Cause I want authentic, not just for fun
If this love is plastic, it'll break on us
'Cause I don't want it if it's fake
I don't want it if it's just for show
I just want it if it's real and I'm thinking I should let you know

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby if you want me, then you better need me

But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
But I just wanna feel you in my heart and on my mind
I can feel you on my lips all the time
And this ain't right

This superficial love thing got me going crazy
Baby, if you want me, then you better need me
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one
And if you wanna keep me, then you better treat me
Like a damn princess, make that an empress
'Cause I'm so done, not being your number one

210,Adele,When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move

Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old

It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old

It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"

To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio

Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation
I know that much is understood

And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth

Not over you

How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here.""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows.
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go.""

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved

I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be (oh, where on earth I could be)
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet)
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street (on the corner of the street)

(So I'm not moving) 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
(I'm not moving) And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I can be
(I'm not moving) Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet
(I'm not moving) And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move"
223,James Bay,Need The Sun To Break,"I'm halfway gone, sleepless I'm battle-worn
You're all I want, bring me the dawn

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm sinking, all my love could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I needed
I hope that I'm not too late, I hope I'm not too late

Back of the room, how come my friends already know you?
Feel like a kid, too shy to speak up so I keep it hid
Oh butterflies, you steal my sleep each night

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm sinking, all my love could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I needed
I hope I'm not too late, and I hope I'm not too late
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm sinking, all my love could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I needed
I hope that I'm not too late, and I hope I'm not too late

Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh."

Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby"

228,Taylor Swift,You Are In Love,"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back

Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough

Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
Blue light reflects
The chain on your neck

He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word

And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face

Pauses, then says
""You're my best friend.""
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing
In a snow globe round your neck
And he keeps the picture
Of you in his office downtown

And you understand now why they
Lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life
Tryin' to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love"
229,John Legend,Love Me Now,"Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over

Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now

Something inside us know's there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

Let's make the most of every moment tonight

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I've got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

She's in line at the door with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

I'm trying to find your light
I can't move through the dust
Getting lost in the night

The storm may come and the rain will fall
Fire and pain go hand in hand - what more
The sun will rise and I may fall
The earth will shake, but I will not be moved

Don't you worry, I'm running, I'm searching
I'm trying to find you, to hold you, I need you

236,The Fray,You Found Me,"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?"

To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

242,Justin Timberlake,Mirrors,"Aren't you somethin' to admire
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as sample
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life

Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life"

244,Leona Lewis,Bleeding Love,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, oh"

To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now
We won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
And love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Together could never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words
I love you and you're beautiful
Now that the wait is over
And love has finally showed her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to
Sing to you
When all the music dies

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will... mmm mmm
Say you will... mmm mmm

248,Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Beautiful

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
And don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful"

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I"
255,Passenger,Patient Love,"Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it, no, I'm not gonna smoke it
'Til we're staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinklin' in the silvery night

Two sips of whiskey in the flask, but I'm not gonna drink 'em
I swear I'll make them last
'Til we're drinkin' out of the same glass, again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well, four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you

Got a Polaroid picture in my wallet
I'm not gonna to tear it, no, I'm not gonna spoil it
It's an unspoken heartbreak
A heartbroken handshake I take with me where I go

And three words on the tip of my tongue
Not to be spoken, nor sung
Or whispered to anyone
'Til I scream 'em at the top of my lungs again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well, four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you, oh woah, and oh, oh, woah
I'll wait for you, oh woah, and oh, oh, woah
And I'll wait for you, oh woah

Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it, no, I'm not gonna smoke it
'Til we're staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinklin' in the silvery night"
256,Sara Bareilles,Love Song,"Head under water
And they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder
Even I know that

You made room for me
But it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If all you have is leavin'
I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today (Yeah)
Today, yeah

I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under you and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm tryin' to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If all you have is leavin'
I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me (Ah, ah, ah)
That you'll leave the light on (Ah, ah, ah)
To help me see (Ah, ah, ah)
With daylight, my guide, gone (Ah, ah, ah)

'Cause I believe, there's a way (Ah, ah, ah)
You can love me because I say I won't write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one (Mhm)
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this

Is that why you wanted, a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this
If you're on your way (Oh, oh)
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute (for a minute)
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today (write you a love song today)
Today, yeah"
257,Seafret,Wildfire,"You think you know all about it then it seems you are wrong
She hit it out of the park before it'd even begun
I needed sunshine in the darkness burning out
Well now I know that I'm the fuel and she's the spark
We are bound to each other's hearts,
Cold, torn, and pulled apart
This love is like wildfire
And to my word now I'll be true,
I can't stop this breaking loose
This love, is like wildfire
Like wildfire
This feelings arranged deep down inside
Try describing a love you can't design
More and more, every inch of me is holding on
This is it all the flames are burning strong
We are bound to each other's hearts,
Cold, torn and pulled apart
This love is like wildfire
And to my word now I'll be true
I can't stop this breaking loose
This love is like wildfire
Like wildfire
Like wildfire
You think you know all about it then it seems you are wrong
She hit it out of the park before it'd even begun
Oh
We are bound to each other's hearts
Cold, torn and pulled apart
This love, is like wildfire
And to my word now I'll be true
I can't stop this breaking loose this love is like wildfire
Like wildfire
Like wildfire
Like wildfire

258,Drake,Do Not Disturb,"Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep till morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"

We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you 'cause

We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music

You're left or right, depending on the day
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change
Lately, lately, I don't like what I've been going through
But I gotta keep my chest from falling for you
I can't, I can't, I can't enter the danger zone
But I open up to someone so cold

(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You don't know what to say
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)

Are you with me, or are you against me
'Cause when I see you, you move too quickly
Fifth time in the week and you're leaving
Then we don't even speak on the weekend
Next week, it's baby forgive me
This time it's different, believe me
Different day, but the same old story
Not ashamed of the way you ignore me

Prove yourself to me

You love me, you hate me
You want me, but then you resent me
I'm ashamed of the way that you treat me
Scheming for you is too easy
What's your number, I'm about to delete it
Same mistake, I'm about to repeat it
We're both too drunk to be speaking
I'm not playing this game (game, game)

'Cause I'm not the type, to give it up, give it up, no
Prove yourself to me
Tell me honestly
You could show yourself to me, but

Driving me insane (driving me insane)

You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

Shit just got real, things are getting intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me
Telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking
Like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love

Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best

I wasn't looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your lovelight

But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you

That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest

And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

Is someone loving you?

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember when, no way, no how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allowed 
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that

But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allowed

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

And when I see you like that

To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me

If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me

And when I see you like that

To see all coming back to me

That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Never too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'

Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I'm winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginnin'

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
Never, never, never
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much"
315,Journey,Faithfully,"Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round
You're on my mind
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love
Along the wire

They say that the road
Ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line
It's been you and me
And lovin' a music man
Ain't always what it's s'posed to be
Oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

Circus life
Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Then everything
Wondering where I am
Lost without you

And being apart ain't easy
On this love affair
Two strangers learn
To fall in love again
I get the joy
Of rediscovering you
Oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm forever yours, ever yours, faithfully"
316,Michael Bolton,How Am I Supposed to Live Without You,"I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Oh, without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone"
317,Heart,These Dreams,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees

White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand (shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands

I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this (all I remember)
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall

(Weaker in my eyesight) Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip (words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"
318,Roberta Flack;Donny Hathaway,The Closer I Get To You,"The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside 
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lying here next to you 
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try

Oh, sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside 
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I've got
Your love has captured me

The closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me
(Me too)
Falling closer, sweet as the gravity

The closer I get (to you)"

All my love with you
No one else will do...

They tell me how much you care

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

I can't resist your charms

321,Stevie Wonder,I Just Called To Say I Love You,"No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, it's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though oh, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah

I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love

Any time you want to, you can turn me on to
Anything you want to, any time at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love, oho

And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I say there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way

Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly

328,Whitney Houston,Greatest Love Of All,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all

That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

I will always be there

Now, I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy my heart and soul can give

Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms

Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

Made it clear suddenly

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today

Somewhere there's a love in flames

340,George Michael,Careless Whisper,"Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

Should have known better, yeah
Oh, oh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
(Should have known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?"
341,Journey,Open Arms,"Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, ""You're so sincere""
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together 
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms 

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back 
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms"
342,Glenn Medeiros,Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You,"If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you if you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart

I cried so many nights

And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh, but what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said I love you, that's forever
And this I promise from the heart, mmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are, right

I don't want clever conversation

My love for you keeps going strong
I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through
I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you

I can see the love shining in your eyes
And it comes as such a sweet surprise
If seeing's believing it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me it's not too late
We're so good together, we're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you baby
A love like ours will never end
Just touch me and we're there again

Just one night
And we'll have that magic feeling like we used to do
Hold on tight
And whatever comes our way we're gonna make it through

If seeing's believing it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me it's not too late
We're so good together, we're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you
And I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby
All the tender love you gave me
When a feeling gets this strong
You know the real thing come along

And I miss you
I miss you like crazy baby

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now 
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take

In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
Of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby

Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got, listen baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got,
Givin' it to you baby"
353,Kenny Rogers,She Believes in Me,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me"
354,Willie Nelson,Always On My Mind,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

Little things I should have
Said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind"
355,Gloria Estefan;Miami Sound Machine,Anything for You,"Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years

Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye"
356,Cyndi Lauper,Time After Time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

Time after time
Time after time

And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Mmmm, somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did, I escaped, uh-huh
I found my way out of the darkness
Kept my faith
I know you did
Kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waitin'
I knew you were waiting for me, uh-huh

With an endless desire I-I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Light the bridges on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don' regret a single moment
No I don't
I know you don't
Looking back, uh
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh
I know you do
I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, ah-ah
I knew you were waiting, ah-ahah
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny, Ooh boy, Oh
I know this love we share was meant to be, No-oah-oh-oh
Knew you were waiting, Woo-Hoo-Ooh-ooh-ooh-wah
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
Oh, I didn't falter
I didn't falter, no

When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Nothing can stop me, no
No way
Knew you were waiting
No I, knew you were waiting for me
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high-gh
I still believe
Oh, when the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Ha, no it didn't stop me, no
Knew you were waiting, stop me
Knew you were, waiting for me, yeah-ah
I didn't falter
Ah, Oh yeah
I still believe
Oh-oh, I still believe
It didn't stop me
Oh, you know it didn't stop me, no
No-oh
Knew you were waiting
Some day
Some way
Some where
Some how
For me
I didn't falter
When the valley was low
I still believe
I still believe
I believe, I believe
It didn't stop me
An army couldn't stop me
Knew you were waiting
No way"
358,Michael Jackson,You Are Not Alone,"Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be, you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone
Alone, all alone, why, alone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Then something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running, darling
And, girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
For you are not alone, for I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone

You are not alone, you are not alone
Said again, you are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
Did you raise for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone
Together, together"
359,Bryan Adams,Heaven,"Oh, thinkin' about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

Yeah, love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, yeah

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along

Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, Heaven, woah

You're all that I want

360,Air Supply,Making Love Out of Nothing at All,"I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

(Note: These italicized lyrics only appear on the demo recording sung by Rory Dodd)
I can make your money double
Or I can make you lose your shirt
I can make your old wounds start to heal
Or I can make the new ones hurt

I can make the music louder
Or I can make the songs all fade
I can make every girl just wanna get up and dance
And make the boys in the band start to play

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love, love)"

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand there's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise

Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I'd gladly go
Anywhere you take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and changed my whole world
Bye bye sadness hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above

And it's so amazing, amazing
I could stay forever, forever
I would leave you never, never
'Cause we've got amazing love
Truly it's amazing, amazing
Love brought us together, together
I would leave you never, never
'Cause we've got amazing love

So amazing and I've been waiting
For a love like you.

It's so amazing to be loved
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above

363,Eric Carmen,All By Myself,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore
 
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore"
364,Richard Marx,Hold On To The Nights,"Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for a while
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise?
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise

What happens now?
Do we break another rule? Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Well, I think I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free
Everytime I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I'm wishing I could give you more

Oh
Hold on to the nights"

Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away

Do you believe a love could pass you by

I was the lonely one, you see

369,Genesis,In Too Deep,"All the time I was searching
Nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
But no-one listening

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Oh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh I know you're going
But I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons for being alone
When I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else

But listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this

Aren't they? Would you like to dance?
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me

That later, on I could drive you home?
No, I don't mind at all

I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, ohoho

I feel the magic between you and I

Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did i take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be.

I got Hungry Eyes"
381,Harry Nilsson,Without You,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
If living is without you"

383,Air Supply,The One That You Love,"Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Don't say the morning's come
Don't say the morning's come so soon
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose

Love is everywhere, I know it is
Such moments as this are too few
Oh, it's all up to you
It's all up to you

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay, oh please
They are the words to say
The only words I can believe

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

The night has gone, a part of yesterday
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways"
384,Phil Collins,You Can't Hurry Love,"I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes
(Well now wait)

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

How it leads me back again
To heartache
I'll never understand

Darling, I
Put my heart up on the shelf
Till the moment was right
And I told myself

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Oh now
As I look into your eyes
Well, I wonder if it's wise
To hold you like I've wanted to before

Tonight
Ooh, I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life
In this heart of mine

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love

388,Olivia Newton-John,Have You Never Been Mellow,"There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day when I just had to tell my point of view
I was like you

Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back, kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you

Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?"
389,Michael Bolton,When a Man Loves a Woman,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend, if he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it oughta be, hey

Well, this man loves you, woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause, baby, baby, ooh

When a man loves a woman, oh
When a man loves a woman, yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman

To let you get away from me

All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word
And tell me that I'm forgiven

You and me
We're gonna be
Better than we were before
I loved you then but now I intend
To open up and love you even more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go

Looking back now
It seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted

But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love
That still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see
It's gonna be
Sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to given more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go

You want me too

Still trying to work it out, never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy

How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we've got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Oh... ain't it time we started trying
Oh... gotta stop this love from dying

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

How can we be lovers
Baby times are rough but we can make it
We can work it out

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)
Till I find her I'll be trying to (Till I find her, I'll be trying to)
Everyday I'm growing kinder
Tryin'
Inclined to
Find her
Inclined to find my baby (My baby)
Been looking everywhere (My baby)
Hey baby I really really care

My determination is fading fast
So fast, so fast so fast
Inspiration is a thing of the past
I can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad
So sad, so sad, I'm sad, so sad, so sad

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my girl)

I feel so bad, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)

Cause everything is gone, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)
And it's hard girl, to carry on,
Since I lost my-, since I lost my-, my, my, my, my baby
I know its up to me, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)
What's gonna happen to me
Since I lost my baby
What's gonna happen to me
Oh I don't, I don't know, what I'm gonna do no, no, no, no I don't know

I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours

There's so many ways I want to say, ""I love you.""
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?

Lady
For so many years, I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever
Let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes, I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

400,Larry Graham,One In A Million You,"Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in
Said you can't win

But one day the sun came a-shining through
The rain had stopped, and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying ""I love you"" to me

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
A one in a million you

I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill
Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth living again
For to love you to me is to live

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
A one in a million you

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
One in a million you

A one in a million you"
401,Linda Ronstadt;James Ingram,Somewhere Out There,"Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true"

Everyday of every year
And I'll always love you
For all that you are
You have made my life complete

That I'd been searching for
You are my everything
Tell me who could ask for more
And I'll always love you
Honey, this will never end
I need you by my side, baby

Whenever I was insecure
You build me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity, baby, just when I thought it was over
And now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again, it'll be the end of me

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Baby, baby, hope you're gonna stay away

I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again, it'll be the end of me

There's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Yes, when the lovin' starts and the lights go down
There's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

C'mon angel my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

How wonderful life is while you're in the world"

What the words and the music have to say

It's so hard to explain 
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face, I just seem to go dry
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high

Thanks for taking me (thanks for taking me)
On a one way trip to the sun (one way trip to the sun)
And thanks for turning me (turning me)
Into a someone (someone)

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry

And I know that my song isn't saying anything new
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

So I sing you to sleep 
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes (after the lovin')
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry (your love is real, it makes me cry)

And I know that my song isn't saying anything new
Oh, but after the lovin' (after the lovin')
I'm still in love with you

I'm still in love with you"
409,Barry Manilow,Even Now,"Even now, when there's someone else who cares
When there's someone home who's waiting just for me
Even now I think about you as I'm climbing up the stairs
And I wonder what to do so she won't see

That even now, when I know it wasn't right
And I found a better life than what we had
Even now I wake up crying in the middle of the night
And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew
Even now

Even now, when I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone
Even now I still remember and the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on
Even now

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And God I wish you knew
Somehow
Even now"
410,Neil Sedaka,Laughter In The Rain,"Strolling along country roads with my baby
It starts to rain, it begins to pour
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

After awhile we run under a tree (after awhile)
I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat)
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside"
411,Michael Bolton,To Love Somebody,"There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
To lived with you, to lived with you
There's a way
Everybody say's
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, I ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, if I ain't got you, baby

You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

Oh yeah
You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody, to love somebody
You don't know, to love somebody the way I love you

413,The Pointer Sisters,Slow Hand,"As the midnight moon was drifting through 
The lazy sway of the trees 
I saw the look in your eyes looking into mine 
Seeing what you wanted to see 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard 
What your body's saying to mine 
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind 

I want a man with a slow hand 
I want a lover with an easy touch 
I want somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground with no one around 
And a blanket of stars in our eyes 
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves 
On the crazy wind of the night 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard 
What your body's saying to mine 
If I want it all night, you say it's alright 
We got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I've found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I've found somebody who will understand 
When it comes to love I want a slow hand 

If I want it all night,
Please say it's alright 
It's not a fast move but a slow groove 
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I've found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I've found somebody who will understand 
I've found a lover with a slow hand

Ooh, lover with a slow hand
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I've found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush

Ooh, lover with a slow hand"
414,Paul Young,Every Time You Go Away,"Hey, if we can solve any problem
Then why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, and so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same thing
Can't you see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on?

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know?

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

415,Debby Boone,You Light Up My Life,"So many nights I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark, but now you've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey, I love you
Never again to be all alone

'Cause you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

'Cause you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you, you light up my life"

418,Kool & The Gang,Cherish,"Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by

I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (oh)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (Baby, yeah)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
(Let's cherish every moment we have together)
For as long as we both shall live
(Hand in hand, you and I)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

(Spoken:)
Cherish the love
Cherish the life

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have

We should cherish the life we live

Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love"
419,Billy Ocean,Suddenly,"I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above,
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Ooh yeah

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before,
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Each day I pray, this love affair would last forever
Oh hoh
Suddenly, Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above,
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly you're in love

Ooh
There's beauty up above,
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly you're in love
Ooh..."
420,Christopher Cross,Sailing,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free"
421,Gary Wright,Dream Weaver,"I've just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the dream weaver train
Driver, take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light
Dream weaver

422,Player,Baby Come Back,"Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And trying to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
I was wrong, and I just can't live

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me"
423,Peabo Bryson,If Ever You're In My Arms Again,"It all came so easy
All the loving you gave me
The feelings we shared
And I still can remember
How your touch was so tender
It told me you cared
We had a once in a lifetime
But I just couldn't see
Until it was gone
A second once in a lifetime
May be too much to ask
But I swear from now on

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end

Now I'm seen clearly
How I still need you near me
I still love you so
There's something between us
That won't ever leave us
There's no letting go
We had a once in a lifetime
But I just didn't know it
Till my life fell apart
A second once in a lifetime
Isn't too much to ask
'Cause I swear from the heart

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end

Never end

The best of romances
Deserve second chances
I'll get to you somehow
'Cause I promise now

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end"

And made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one
Since you took me in
I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow
Reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow
If you should go away

I'll stand here and remember
Just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on"

Just stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You, you belong to me now
Ain't gonna set ya free now
When those girls start hanging around, talking me down
Hear with your heart and ya won't hear a sound

Just stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I been thinking of you

But someday your looks'll be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turning you on

While others pretend
I need ya now and I need ya then

A little more than I should
We both know I've got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
But this is pure and simple
And you must realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I love you
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along every day
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you got the chance to say

I love you
I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born in another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours and here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it like this

I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love you"

Every time I think of you 
I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here 
And you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself
Ain't missing you

I ain't missing you

Tryin' hard to recreate what had yet to be created
Once in her life she musters a smile
For his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in here long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems to be (If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing (Fool's got the power)
And nothing at all (Oh, now)
What a fool believes (I believe she's never gone away)
He sees (Oh)
No wise man has the power (To reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be (Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (Better than nothing)
And nothing at all"
433,Styx,Babe,"Babe, I'm leaving, I must be on my way
The time is drawing near
My train is going, I see it in your eyes
The love, the need, your tears

But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

You know it's you, babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

You know it's you, babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

Babe, I'm leaving, I'll say it once again
Somehow try to smile
I know the feeling we're trying to forget
If only for a while

And I'll need your love to see me through

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well, I don't really know her
I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin
You're never quite the same

You'll want her just the same

I set out to get you with a fine toothed comb
I was soft inside
There was somethin' going on

You do somethin' to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on

Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Honest love, we feel, needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Making love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

You can reach me on an airplane, you can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

You can reach me by sailboat, climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt, cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer

You can make it in a big balloon, but you better make it soon

In time your broken heart will mend

I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better

456,Atlantic Starr,Secret Lovers,"Here we are the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out
It could mess up, both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
They can never no, oh no, we can't leave a trace

Secret lovers that's what we are, we shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go, oh no, 'cause we love each other so

Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously, alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall

Secret lovers that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go, 'cause what we feel is oh so real
So real

You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel, or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin' love we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful, so that no one will know

Secret lovers, that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is oh so real
So real"

458,Seal,Kiss From A Rose,"There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea,
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know, that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny,
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I'm kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby, the stranger it feels, yeah
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
And if I should fall, would it all go away?
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny,
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

460,Jim Brickman;Michael W. Smith,Love of My Life,"I am amazed 
When I look at you
I see you smiling back at me
It's like all my dreams come true 

I am afraid 
If I lost you, girl
I'd fall through the cracks 
And lose my track in this crazy lonely world

Sometimes it's so hard to believe 
When the nights can be so long
And faith gave me the strength 
And kept me holding on

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me

I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life

Now here you are 
With midnight closing in
You take my hand as our shadows dance
With moonlight on your skin

I look in your eyes
I'm lost inside your kiss
I think if I'd never met you
About all the things I'd missed

Sometimes it's so hard to believe
When a love can be so strong 
And faith gave me the strength 
And kept me holding on

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me

I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me

I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love
My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life"
461,Tim McGraw,Don't Take The Girl,"Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind

And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there, won't be any harm

And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees

And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old"

You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand
I care about you
So much about you, baby
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh no
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do

464,Bread,Make It With You,"Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows
But, baby, here goes

Dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wondering what this song is leading to
I want to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Though you don't know me well
In every little thing only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
Then we'll see it through

Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Baby, you know that
Dreams, they're for those who sleep

466,Survivor,The Search Is Over,"How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes"

468,The Temptations,Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me),"Mm, hmm, mm
Ooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, you're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
Ooh-ooh, ooh, hoo (so)

Soon we'll be married and raise a family (oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination once again
Running away with me
Telling you it was just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I would surely die

Mm, her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

Just my imagination once again
Running away with me
Oh, tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her, but I can't forget her

Just my imagination, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Running away with me
Ooh, just my imagination
Running away with me"

470,Jim Croce,Time In A Bottle,"If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with"
471,Amy Grant,That's What Love Is For,"Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way.

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far.

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it.
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for.

Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away by emotions
I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find


Believing in the one thing
That has gotten us this far
That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it.
Round off the edges
Talk us down from the ledges
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

That's what love is for.
That's what love is for
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for.
That's what love is for.
That's what love is for.
That's what love is for."

Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean

Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night

With one hand free
Let the world back into me
And, oh, I'll be a sight to see

To make life be life to me
And I hope that you're still out there
And you're like you used to be

And we'll dance 'til the morning sun
And we'll let the good times come in
And we won't stop 'til we're done

Will open up again

We'll be back in the high life again

They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me

Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?

Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know

479,Luther Vandross,There's Nothing Better Than Love,"(Luther)
I
Fell asleep late last night...
And I dreamed the night and almost half the day away...
I just got up
So that I can hear her say
She still in love
And no one can take her love away

(Gregory)

Oh love...
Wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
She fills me up
Everytime I hear her say...
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away

I wanna be loved...

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of...
No matter how far...
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love...
To Love

(Luther)
And I
Mean all these words I say...
You don't have to guess
What's going on inside my head

(Gregory)

Try to know
All the tings that our hearts say...
Listen to love
And only let love lead the way

I wanna be loved...

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of...
No matter how far...
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love...

(For love)
(For love)

(Luther)
You know for love I would go anywhere...

(For love)

(Gregory)

(For love)

(Luther)
For love...
To the ends of nowhere

(Gregory)
And for her love

(And for her love)

(Both)
I would go
I would go
I...
I would love
Would love
To just spend all my time

(Gregory)
With a girl
Who makes me feel her love is mine...

(Luther)
Some one you see
Who would only dream of me...
She be in love

('Cause she wants to be)
(She wants to be loved)

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of...
No matter how far...
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love...
To Love

Love... love

There's nothing better than love (oh oh oh...)
What in the world could you ever be thinking of... (oh...)
No matter how far...
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love...

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of...
No matter how far...
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love...(Fade)"

482,Anne Murray,You Needed Me,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me"
483,Elton John,Candle In The Wind,"Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid

Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did"
484,Jim Croce,I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song,"Well, I know it's kinda late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I've gotta say can't wait
I know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kinda strange
But every time I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Every time the time was right
All the words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kinda late
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just gotta say
Know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song"
485,The Pointer Sisters,Fire,"I'm ridin' in your car
I turn on the radio
You're pullin' me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire

Late at night
You're takin' me home
You say you wanna stay
I say I wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire

You had a hold on me
Right from the start
A grip so tight
I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin'
Actin' like a fool
Well, your kisses they burn
But my heart stays cool

Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet
A love they couldn't deny
My words say split
But my words they lie
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire

Ooh, fire
Kisses like fire
Burn me up with fire
I like what you're doin' now
Fire
Touchin' me
Fire
Touchin' me
Burnin' me
Fire
Take me home"

487,Bread,Baby I'm-A Want You,"Baby I'm-a want you
Baby I'm-a need you
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'm-a crazy
But I just can't live without
Your lovin' and affection
Givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour
Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why

Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You taught me why

Baby I'm-a want you
Baby I'm-a need you

Oh, it took so long to find you, baby

Baby I'm-a want you
Baby I'm-a need you"
488,Charlie Rich,The Most Beautiful Girl,"Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?

If you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?"
489,Dolly Parton,Here You Come Again,"Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go

Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I go"
490,Anne Murray,Danny's Song,"People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like him and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
The sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah, and don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right"
491,Dan Fogelberg,Longer,"Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We'll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years, as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with you"

493,Kenny Chesney,Me and You,"Ordinary no, really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny, we were meant to be
Me and you

Like a perfect scene, from a movie screen
Where every dream come true
Suited perfectly, for eternity
Me and you

Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way, I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

Everyday I live, try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above, that we share this love
Me and you

Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

Ordinary no, really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last, get as lucky as
Me and you"

495,Céline Dion,Where Does My Heart Beat Now,"So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed, I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keeping your heart next to mine

But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?

Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream

I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?

Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?

Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Ohoho!

I need someone to give my heart to
I feel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger, yeah, yeah

And I feel inside
Hearts are made to last till the end of time"
496,Heart,Alone,"I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight
Oh, you don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Oh ooh oh
'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone
Alone"

498,George Jones,He Stopped Loving Her Today,"He said, ""I'll love you 'til I die""
She told him, ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half-crazy, now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated nineteen sixty-two
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time, he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today"

Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
Girl

A room is a still a room, even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears

Pretty little darling, have a heart, don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there, sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah...

I want you and need to be, yeah
Still in love with me
Say you're gonna be in love with me

Couldn't be still in love with me

And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore, oh, oh

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove

Well there was no risk that I wouldn't take
And not a promise that I didn't make
All I asked was that you just hold on
Now I'm a wondering what I did wrong

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

I gave you all of my body and soul
Never believing we might lose control
I took my hands off the wheel

I can't remember if the lies were true
It's been a million years since I touched you
Well I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you"
508,Toto,Africa,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)

I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take some time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh"
509,Luther Vandross,Stop to Love,"Lately love
Keeps keeping me 'wake at night
Tossing and turning, my love
Want to kiss
Want to hold you so tight
Ooh, but I wonder, love
Whether you know or not
When you just hurry away
Leaving me laying there in shock

I just want to be
The one that you want to see
I just want to have you near me
But you fly away almost everyday
You work a lot
You never stop to love

(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
Got to stop to love

Yeah, you say my love
Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime
Too many empty nights
Could make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's alone at home

Awaiting the day
That you are coming to stay
I hate to see you go away
But you couldn't rest
Had to be the best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Got to stop to love)

And one day you'll discover
I'm the one who loves you
(Got to stop to love)
And no one does you better
Can't you stay forever
(Stop to love)
I can hardly stand the loneliness
(Ooh)
Come on, stay
(Yeah)
'Cause that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

I love you, stop
(Stop)
Love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Got to stop to love)

I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
Got to stop to love

I love you, stop

I still love you, stop

510,Belinda Carlisle,Heaven Is A Place On Earth,"Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down
I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in the wave of love

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

When I feel alone
I reach for you and you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice and it carries me

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

511,Whitney Houston,Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of me and you

We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we almost have it all"

It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong

Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up 
When you fall? 
Who's gonna hang it up

Who's gonna pay attention

513,Whitney Houston,Run to You,"Ooh, I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl, who's scared sometimes 
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night, I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh woah, what's the sense 
Of trying hard to find your dreams?
Without someone to share them with
Tell me, what does it mean?

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?
Run away

No, I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
No, if you only knew 
How much I wanna run to you
Know I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?"
514,Natalie Cole,This Will Be (An Everlasting Love),"This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me

I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me

Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh

This will be an everlasting love
Oh, yes it will now

You brought a lot of a sunshine into my life
You filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you

This will be
You and me
Yes sir-ee
Eternally
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing together forever through ever whatever
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you and me
So long as I'm living true love I'll be giving to you I'll be serving 'cause you're so deserving
Hey, you're so deserving, you're so deserving

515,Elton John,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best"
516,Luther Vandross,Power of Love / Love Power,"When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it
Let the feelin' sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone you see
How much better the world could be
For them and for you, for me
With the power of love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
My-my-my-my-my-my
You've got to feel the power
Yeah, yeah

So listen up and you will hear it
A symphony from above, it's the power of love
So glad we've found it, now there's no way around it
Just let the feeling sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that you can't deny
Is the power of love

When we walk down the street
We don't care who we see or who we meet
Don't need to run, don't need to hide
'Cause we've got something burning inside, yeah

We've got love power
It's the greatest power of them all, ooh... ooh...
We've got love power
And together we can't fall, sing it with

We've got love (Love) power (Power)
It's the greatest power of them all
Oh, we've got love (Love) power (Power)

517,Bette Midler,Wind Beneath My Wings,"Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh and I, I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away
You let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you
The wind beneath my wings"

Close to me

I'm longing for the time

And you've got nobody, the lonely hours over here

Distant lover, lover
Oh, so many miles away
Oh, heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover, oh lover, 
You should think about me, say a prayer for me
Please, please, baby
Think about me sometime, think about me yeah
Here in misery, misery

As I reminisce
Oh, baby, through our joyful summer together
The promises we made of the daily letter
Then all of a sudden everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window, sugar, down the lonesome road

Distant lover, oh, sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Don't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it like it was a precious jewel
Oh, baby

Lord, have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Something I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
Now, Lord
I wonder do you wanna hear me scream and plead
Please, please, please, come back home girl
Please, baby, come back home

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Oh, something I wanna say
When you left to go away
No other do I want, do you wanna have me plead and scream
Please, please, oh please, baby
Come back home, girl

It seems the natural thing to do

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, tonight"

It swings (woo-ooo), it jives (woo-woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish

She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever

I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight

I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes 
And on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all

Always just beyond my touch
Though I needed you so much
After all what else is living for

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all"
527,Mariah Carey,Vision of Love,"Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me

It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized the love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that Heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny (all that I did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

(Prayed through the nights) Prayed through the nights
(So faithfully) So faithfully (faithfully)
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be"

The tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
And don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Cause I've seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now

I get angry too

Don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour

You're feeling all alone
Walking on your own

529,Gino Vannelli,Living Inside Myself,"In my life
I've felt so self assured
But suddenly it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wond'ring in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need a guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh how all the seasons change
And now I'm not that strong

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost"

531,Billy Joel,This Is the Time,"We walked on the beach beside that old hotel
They're tearing it down now, but it's just as well
I haven't shown you everything a man can do
So stay with me baby, I got plans for you

This is the time to remember
'Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
'Cause we won't although we'll want to

This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
But now I need the rest of you

Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived?
Someday we will both look back and have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime and the aftermath

This is the time to remember
'Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
'Cause we won't although we'll want to

This is the time
But time is gonna change
I know we gotta move somehow
But I don't want to lose you now

Sometimes it's so easy to let a day slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time you'll turn back to and so will I
And those will be days you can never recall

And so we embrace again behind the dunes
This beach is so cold on winter afternoons
Ah, but holding you close is like holding the summer sun
I'm warm from the memory of days to come

This is the time to remember
'Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
'Cause we won't although we'll want to

This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
But now I need the rest of you"

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy
No, my heart just can't hide
That old feelin' inside
Way deep down inside
Oh, baby
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

You say he satisfies your mind
Tells you all of his dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
No, it just ain't true

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy
That old flame comes alive
It starts burning inside
Way deep down inside

The thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling
Let it be me

Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you

When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

(No rain) No rain
(Or winter's cold Can stop me baby) Ooh baby
(Baby) Baby
(If you're my goal) Oh
(No wind) No wind
(No rain) No rain

I know, I know you must follow the sun
Where ever it leads
But remember, if you should fall short of your desires
Remember life's holds to you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you the day I set you free

Just to hold her in my arms again

See her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place
I've got to see her again

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again

I can't hide it, no
I can't fight it, oh
It's so hard to live without the love
She gave to me

Doesn't she know it?
I tried hard not to show it
Can't I make her realize that she
Really needs me again?

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do

541,Sinéad O'Connor,Nothing Compares 2 U,"It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do.""
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you"
542,Kenny Rogers,You Light up My Life,"So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dream I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now you've come along

You light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey, I love you
Never again to be all alone

You light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Oh you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you, you light up my life..."
543,Mary MacGregor,Torn Between Two Lovers,"There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

Torn between two lovers

Feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules"

We have never played the games that real lovers do
So maybe we are better off

That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love (you're in love)
And I know
That you're not in love with me

Ooh, it's enough for me to know
That you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

I tried to find you but you were so far away
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me
Someday (someday), someday, someday
Ooh, you're in love

Ooh, it's enough for me to know
That you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

No, no
No, no
No, no, no, no"

I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely

Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now, so far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay?

Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes now so fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today

So there it is, girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?

I know it's late and I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light, come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?"

To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love

So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection, and so do I

It's gonna take a lotta love 
To get us through the night 
It's gonna take a lotta love 
To make this work out right 

So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon 
You know I need relating, not solitude

Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love

I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much, but something's wrong
There's something here doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine

Seeing you
Or seeing anything as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through

It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should

It's important to me
That you know you are free

Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet

But I want you to know
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart
And I would wait till the end
Of time for you
And do it again, it's true
I can't measure my love
There's nothing to compare it to

But I want you to know
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Oh, if I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

If I could fly
I'd pick you up

Come fill me again

Come let me love you
Let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter
Let me die in your arms

Let me lay down beside you
Let me always be with you
Come let me love you
Come love me again

562,Meat Loaf,I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),"And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way
You feel right now, oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

But I won't do that, ah
No, I won't do that

And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing
I've ever seen before or will again

And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself
If we don't go all the way tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that

And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God of
Sex and drums and rock 'n' roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I'm watching you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
And I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you

Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this god forsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
Oh, I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot, ha?
Will you take me places I've never known?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

After awhile you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on

I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around

I would do anything for love

No, I won't do that"
563,Alison Krauss,When You Say Nothing At All,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all"

All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feelin', knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darlin' I never showed you (no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (but I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way

Morning, just another day

Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy

Far away, from the city

Ooh baby I love your way,
I Wanna tell you I love your way,
I Wanna be with you night and day

Moon appears to shine, and light the sky,
With the help, of some fireflys
I Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine,
I Can see them, under the pine

But Don't hesitate,

Ooh baby I love your way,
I Wanna tell you I love your way,
I Wanna be with you night and day

Well don't, don't hesitate,
'Cause your love, won't wait,

I Can see the sunset in your eyes,
Brown and grey, and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun,
I wish I could buy one, out of season,

But don't hesitate,

Ooh baby I love your way,
I wanna tell you I love you way,
I Wanna be with you night and day
Ooh baby I love your way"

I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore

My mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore

Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel about you
'Cause there's no one else I swear that holds a candle anywhere next to you
My heart can't take the beating, not having you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending I don't love you anymore

I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life

My tears no longer waiting, ooh my resistance ain't that strong

Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come with me to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be.

Oh, that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well, I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou"

Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show 
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away"

Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go, I just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you

Magic, it must be magic
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes

There's something wrong here, there can be no denyin'
One of us is changing or maybe we've just stopped tryin'

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no, no

There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too
Still, I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it now)
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no, no, no, no, no

It's too late, baby
It's too late, now darling
It's too late"
579,Tony! Toni! Toné!,It Never Rains (In Southern California),"I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait till I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
Girl you know the rest 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your eight by ten by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...

Oh it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

We have so much to talk about
A lot of catchin' up to do
I'll bring the diamond girl
Because I'm so into you
'Cause they tell me...

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now since I'll be here at your place
Lets take a weeks trip for two
We don't have to go to far

Just as long as I'm with you
'Cause they tell me...

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Can we just be alone
Without those other strangers
Calling your phone
Now I don't want to be
That selfish kind of guy
But tonight let me take you
On a natural high

Just me and you alone

Now it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

Now it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

It never rains in southern California

580,Peabo Bryson,Can You Stop The Rain,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, girl

Here's another morning without you
Here's another day, will I get through
Without breaking down

Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on
Baby, I've been living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days, they're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day, baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain? Oh, oh

Everywhere I go I feel you there
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart

Sometimes it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking
And there you are

Am I all alone
Don't you ever wake up and reach for me
Where I used to be
Is there any chance
I just can't believe you're not lonely too
Just for me and you

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day, baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain? Oh, oh

If you are here for only one night
Baby, I know you remember
'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough
I know we can make it together, together

Baby, stop the rain
Won't you chase my clouds away
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears of mine from falling
I can't face another day, baby, can you stop
Can you, can you stop the rain

Can you stop the rain? Yeah
How can I live without you, baby?
How can I let you go? Yeah
Chase my clouds away, yeah"

582,Barry White,Just The Way You Are,"(Speaking)
I never take anything for granted
Only a fool maybe takes things for granted
Just because it's here today
It can be gone tomorrow
And that's one thing that you
Never in your life ever have to worry about me
If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby I love you
Yeah I love you
Just the way... You are...

Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are.

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you.

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from my heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are."

We belong together and you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry

Higher and higher, it's burning through to my soul

My brain is flaming, I don't know which way to go

Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming, I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning, and nothing can cool me, yeah
I just might turn to smoke, but I feel fine

'Cause your kisses lift me higher

And you light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer, the flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me, I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe, my chest is a-heaving

587,Bread,Everything I Own,"You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much 
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again"

It's late September, and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face

You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days"

Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
Smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'

And when violets turn red
And roses turn blue
I'll be still in love with you

Every night and day

When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall

To get you into my world
And hold you within

It's a right I'll defend

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you

To tell me you were coming down 
Oh you look so out of place on this troubled side of town 
It's a place where losers go when they know there's nothing left 
And after losing you I just lost the will to live 

Do you believe me now? 
I told you time and time again 
My heart and soul is your hands do you believe me now? 
Do you believe me now? 
Look at the living I endure 
I ain't nothing without you do you believe me now? 

I don't know what changed your mind, come-on ask if this is real 
I don't know what if you're a dream I only know how good it feels 
If you could find it in your heart to say the fire for me still burns 
I'll find a place to turn around down this road of no return 

Do you believe me now? 
I told you time and time again 
My heart and soul is your hands do you believe me now? 
Do you believe me now? 
Look at the living I endure 
I ain't nothing without you do you believe me now?"
605,10cc,I'm Not In Love,"I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

Be quiet, big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

Oooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Oooh, you'll wait a long time
Oooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Oooh, you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love
I'm not in love!"
606,Barbra Streisand,The Way We Were,"Memories 
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"
607,Christopher Cross,Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do) - Remastered,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ...
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ...
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ...
The best that you can do is fall in love"
608,Sarah McLachlan,I Will Remember You,"I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Weep not for the memories"
609,Carpenters,Goodbye To Love,"I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it

So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way, I guess I've always known

I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose its bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in and to live for
Something I could live for

All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten, I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song

And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
610,Johnny Lee,Lookin' For Love,"I spent a lifetime lookin' for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fools game, hopin' to win
Tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Hoping to find a friend and lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

I was alone then, no love in sight
I did everything I could to get me through the night
I don't know where it started or where it might end
I turned to a stranger just like a friend

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

You came knockin' on my heart's door
You're everything I've been looking for

No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for love

Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for love"
611,Bon Jovi,Always,"This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Always, always"
612,Nazareth,Love Hurts,"Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Or strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not fooling me

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh..."

I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love

I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give

You brightened every day
With your sweet smile

Didn't I tell you

615,Bonnie Tyler,Holding Out for a Hero,"Where have all good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone, somewhere, watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night"
616,Ray Price,For the Good Times,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on 
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad 
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges 
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops 
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me 
One more time for the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops 
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me 
One more time for the good times"

People saying that you're no good for me
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""
Oh
If you loved me baby, you'd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom

I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
Bet you someday baby someone says the same to you

619,Sarah McLachlan,When She Loved Me,"When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart

And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me

Through the summer and the fall
We had each other, that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be

And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that
She loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
""I will always love you""

Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
When she loved me"

So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night
For feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night

And who else can I turn to

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me

It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone

Seedy motels and no star motels still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my mind
Was the sweet love I had with you

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light

Can't you find it in you to forgive me
Cause here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone

And not feel you going through me
Split the second hat I never think of you
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible

Giving him something he can feel
Let me give what what you really need, baby

You know, baby
I just can't get enough of your funky stuff, no, no
Oh, oh, baby
You make it so good
You turn a woman around
Yes, you will
And I wanna run it
And tell it all over town

Living in a world of ghetto life
Everybody around seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong
And it's all right, my man
I like the kind of ways we have our fun
Your loving ways send me on an on
Yeah, with my man

People out there can you understand
Giving him something he can feel
To let him know this love is real

Giving him something he can feel
To let him know this love is real

Do you know
Do you know
Do you know

Giving him something he can feel
Giving him something he can feel..."

627,Peter Cetera;Chaka Khan,Feels Like Heaven (with Chaka Khan),"All through my wandering years
I always said
I was biding my time
All alone in the dark
I'd faced my fears
That no other heart would come to mine

At first when you found me
It took me a while
Till I realised
Why I felt weak
When you were around
Why I couldn't speak
When I looked in your eyes

All this time
I've been searching
Until you, I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love
Could feel like heaven
Watching over me

Wherever you are
Invisible hands reach over the miles
For every wish
You make to the stars
There's one silent kiss
I send to the sky

All this time
I've been searching
Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I [pause] never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me

Everything's changed
Since you came my way
(Since you came my way)
You put the colour
In a world of grey
And you make the love
That carries me away

All this time
I've been searching
Until you
I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could
Feel like heaven
Watching over me
You know that it feels like heaven
Watching over me

Watching over me

Feels like heaven"
628,Major Harris,Love Won't Let Me Wait,"The time is right
You hold me tight
And love is got me high

Please tell me, yes
And don't say no, honey not tonight
I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
Till I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
'Cause love won't let me wait
(Not one more minute, baby)

The time is right
Turned down the lights and take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night in a wonderland
Now move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait

(No, listen girl)

I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstacy
And I won't take the blame
'Cause love won't let me wait, no
Love won't let me wait (my temperature's rising)
Love won't let me wait (cause your so tantalizing)

(Oh, listen girl)

Love won't let me wait"
629,Gordon Lightfoot,If You Could Read My Mind,"If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back"
630,Whitney Houston,I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),"Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done all right up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

631,Bonnie Raitt,I Can't Make You Love Me,"Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't"

White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way 
(We've only begun)

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run
(And yes we've just begun)

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
(And yes we've just begun)

When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
La-la la-la-la

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?

To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song...

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly

He was strumming my pain
Yeah he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song"

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up, never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me, ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me

Oh, you were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh, when I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me, hey, yeah

Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far away

Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

Walking home every day
Over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce about the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember
How warm and tender
We were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend

'My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you"

Come take my hand and together we will rise

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love
On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, flying high upon the wings of love

You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
And I'm crazy 'bout ya, baby, can't you see
I'd be so delighted if you would come with me

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love
On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, flying high upon the wings of love

Yes, you belong to me and I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live and breathe each other
Inseparable it seems, we're flowing like a stream
Running free travelling on the wings of love

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love
On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, together flying high

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love
On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, together flying high
Upon the wings of love, of love"

642,Stevie Wonder,Lately,"Lately I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you has been hanging
Round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say, no special place to go
But when I ask, 'Will you be coming back soon?'
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I had no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But, when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say, 'Nothing's changed'

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Oh, I'm a man of many wishes

My eyes won't let me hide

'Cause this time could mean goodbye"

About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low

The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

But you see
The winner takes it all!
The winner takes it all!

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall

Throw a dice
Cold as ice
Way down here
Someone near

Takes it all
Has to fall
Can't explain
I complain

Now that your around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once the page is read
All but life is dead
That is my belief

And yes I know 
How lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that your around me"
649,Rose Royce,Wishing On A Star,"I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishin' on tomorrow, praying it'll come
And I'm wishin' on all the lovin' we've ever done

I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me

Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go, for me you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
That in the game of lovin', you reap what you sow

I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Whether or never

I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Whether or never

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people we ever greeted
And I'm hopin' on all the days to come and days to go
And I'm hopin' on days of lovin' you so

I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see

I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a star"
650,Atlantic Starr,Masterpiece,"A simple touch of your hand,
And everything is right.
The gentle way you look at me,
When we kiss goodnight.
You've given me the freedom no other love has known
And now I thank you girl, thank you girl

The countless ways you've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away
A picture perfect painting, that's what our love is
And yes I need you so, and now I know

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

Sometimes I wonder what I'd be
Had I not found you
A lost and lonely soul this world
Could show me nothing new

But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be
And now I see

The two of us together
Through time will never part
This fairy tale we sharing
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise I do make
Heaven is ours to take

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

When I'm lost and insecure
You build me up and make me sure
That everything will turn out right
My love

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end)"
651,Phil Collins,Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now),"How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh-ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now 
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me now"
652,Journey,Don't Stop Believin',"Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
Smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'

I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love, it's suicide

You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I live and I die for you
I'll steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well, I can't promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And baby, you know my hands are dirty
(Well, woman you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'd be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can let go

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation is worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies

And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I want to give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, see a ray of light
Oh, see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Oh yeah

Baby, there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey

And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want your answer baby

""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep.
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, mmm hmm
Think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise

Just think about it

And you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray
But man, they're really coming back

I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your light
There's a color deep inside them
Like blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe

I don't need to be a superman
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah

Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back
And makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you, oh oh

(Heaven isn't too far away)
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way

Whoa, oh

I've got mine, woman you've got yours too

Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye

How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend

Remember when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby

Remember when we used to talk
About busting out - we'd break their hearts
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go

Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye"

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)

I've never seen you shine so bright

I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me

And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand, someone who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you""

Say you, say me
Say it for always, oh
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star

There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

All day long, I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd 
Try as they may, they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)

Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you""

More than words
La-di-da-di-da

Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?

681,Vanessa Williams,Save The Best For Last,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

La la la la la la la
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last
Yeah, yeah"

683,Richard Marx,Right Here Waiting,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you, waiting for you"
684,Air Supply,Even the Nights Are Better,"I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better

685,Céline Dion,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember when, no way, no how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allowed 
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allowed
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me...
Now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this

686,Michael Bolton,How Am I Supposed to Live Without You,"I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Oh, without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone"
687,Heart,These Dreams,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees

White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand (shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands

I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this (all I remember)
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall

(Weaker in my eyesight) Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip (words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"

By giving me all you've got

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside 
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lying here next to you 
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try

Oh, sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again

Falling closer, sweet as the gravity

The closer I get (to you)"

And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I say there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night

Turning and returning

Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning

Suitcase of memories
Time after

You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow""

Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

You keep me comin' back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms

We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

Yeah, love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, yeah

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along

Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, Heaven, woah

You're all that I want
You're all that I need"
699,Air Supply,Making Love Out of Nothing at All,"I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall

(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

(Note: These italicized lyrics only appear on the demo recording sung by Rory Dodd)
I can make your money double
Or I can make you lose your shirt
I can make your old wounds start to heal
Or I can make the new ones hurt

I can make the music louder
Or I can make the songs all fade
I can make every girl just wanna get up and dance
And make the boys in the band start to play

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love, love)"
700,Shania Twain,You're Still The One,"Looks like we made it

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

You're still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together still goin' strong

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?

Now the night has gone away
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Don't say the morning's come
Don't say the morning's come so soon
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose

Love is everywhere, I know it is
Such moments as this are too few
Oh, it's all up to you
It's all up to you

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay, oh please
They are the words to say
The only words I can believe

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

704,Michael Bolton,When a Man Loves a Woman,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend, if he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it oughta be, hey

Well, this man loves you, woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause, baby, baby, ooh

When a man loves a woman, oh
When a man loves a woman, yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman

I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you care when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you and with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

My love
Whenever I was insecure
You build me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you I always had a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new"

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know?

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

A certain kind of light
That never shone on me

There's a way
Everybody say's
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, I ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, if I ain't got you, baby

You don't know what it's like

(Missing you)
(Missing you)

Every time I think of you 
I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here 
And you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself
Ain't missing you

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no

No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you"

So please believe me, my heart is in your hands

Come between the two of us

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl, to me
And you'll always be, eternally
Everytime I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch, you can do so much

No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true

714,Survivor,The Search Is Over,"How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes"

Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
But you never see me fall apart

It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night
Good night

I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are, ah
But you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer 
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby"
717,Anne Murray,You Needed Me,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me"

Baby I'm-a need you
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'm-a crazy
But I just can't live without
Your lovin' and affection
Givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour
Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why

Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You taught me why

Baby I'm-a want you
Baby I'm-a need you

Oh, it took so long to find you, baby

Baby I'm-a want you
Baby I'm-a need you"

We were as one, babe

And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine

Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely

720,Peabo Bryson,Tonight I Celebrate My Love,"Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, tonight"
721,Shania Twain;Bryan White,From This Moment On,"I do swear
That I'll always be there
I'd give anything, everything
And I will always care
Through weakness and strength
Happiness and sorrow
For better, for worse
I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment
Life has begun
From this moment
You are the one
Right beside you
Is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment
I have been blessed
I live only
For your happiness
And for your love
I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you
I can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment
As long as I live
I will love you
I promise you this
There is nothing
I wouldn't give
From this moment on
Oh

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment
As long as I live
I will love you
I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment
I will love you
As long as I live
From this moment on, mmm"
722,Cher;Peter Cetera,After All (Love Theme From Chances Are),"Well, here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight

I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes 
And on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all

Always just beyond my touch
Though I needed you so much
After all what else is living for

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all"
723,Mary MacGregor,Torn Between Two Lovers,"There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

Torn between two lovers

Feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules"
724,Barry Manilow,Mandy,"I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you"
725,Bread,If,"If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show 
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away"
726,Boyz II Men,End Of The Road,"Spoken:
Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together and you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' it 'round and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me, you just don't realize
You've never been there before, it's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm going to do)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Spoken:
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out and cheat at night, just like you did baby
But that's alright, (Huh) I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you just come back to me
(Lonely) Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts baby
(Lonely) I feel pain too
Baby please

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Although we've come, to the end of the road  (Although we've come to the end of the road)

727,Bread,Everything I Own,"You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much 
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again"
728,Nazareth,Love Hurts,"Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Or strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not fooling me

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh..."
729,Whitney Houston,Saving All My Love for You,"A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist
Being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night
For feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night 
That I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For you"
730,Carpenters,We've Only Just Begun,"We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way 
(We've only begun)

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run
(And yes we've just begun)

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
(And yes we've just begun)

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song...

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly

He was strumming my pain
Yeah he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song"
732,Glenn Frey,Lover's Moon,"There's a lover's moon tonight
As I look back over my shoulder
All the stars are shining bright
Just like the nights when I used to hold her
She's out there somewhere under the lover's moon

Lover's moon won't you shine on me
I'm dancing with a memory
Wish I may, I wish I might
Have one last chance to hold her tight

And she's waiting, I know she's waiting
I know she waits for me
Under the lover's moon

There's a lover's moon tonight
Shining down on half of this world
So many souls are in its light
But for me there is just one girl

And she's waiting, I know she's waiting
I know she waits for me
Under the lover's moon"

A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
Till the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong

734,Def Leppard,When Love & Hate Collide,"You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone, girl
For the hundredth time

I got your number on my wall
But I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand, baby
United, we fall

Got the time, got a chance, gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart, gonna take it
All I know, I can't fight this way

You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
Time after time

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you, baby
Do you have a heart of stone

Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other, baby
Like an act of war

I could tell a million lies
And it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger
Hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know, got to win this time

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you, baby
Do you have a heart of stone

Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
Crazy, crazy

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you, baby
Do you have a heart of stone

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you, baby

Can't stop the hurt inside

When I dance with you 

Promise me you're mine tonight 
I've been waitin' lyin' tonight 
While the lights are right 
I'll never let you go 

Did I dream that we danced forever 
In a wish that we made together 
On a night that I prayed would never end? 

You know it's not my imagination 
Or a part of the orchestration 
Love was here at the coronation 
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts 

Time will pass and tears will fall 
But someday we'll both recall 
Moments made of this 
Golden memories

On a night that I prayed would never end? (END) 

No, it's not my imagination 
Or a part of the orchestration

I apologize, baby, that's fine
I would wait forever just to know you were mine

I love what you wear, isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional, I can't wait for the rest of my life

In a world that's full of strangers; 
You've got to believe in magic 
Somethin' stronger than the moon above 
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love."
740,David Pomeranz,Born For You,"Too many billion people
Running around the planet
What is the chance in heaven
That you'd find your way to me
Tell me what is this sweet sensation
It's a miracle that's happened
Though I search for an explanation
Only one thing it could be

That I was born for you
It was written in the stars
Yes I was born for you
And the choice was never ours

It's as if the powers of the universe
Conspired to make you mine
And till the day I die
I bless the day that I was born for you

Too many foolish people
Trying to come between us
None of them seem to matter
When I looked into your eyes

Now I know why I belong here
In your arms I found the answer
Somehow nothing would seem so wrong here
If they'd only realize

That I was born for you
And that you were born for me
And in this random world
This was clearly meant to be

What we have the world
Could never understand
Or ever take away
And till the day I die
I bless the day that I was born for you

Oh I was

What we have the world
Could never understand
Or ever take away
And as the years go by
Until the day I die
I bless the day that I was born for you"

742,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
743,Coldplay,The Scientist,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start"

It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do

Then you keep loving me
Just love me, yeah

All you need to do is love me yeah
Got me like ah-ah-ah-ow

746,Meghan Trainor;John Legend,Like I'm Gonna Lose You,"I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows

We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know

So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets

So let's take our time to say what we want
Here's what we got before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

Hey
Whoa

I'm gonna love you (oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted

747,Jamie Lawson,Wasn't Expecting That,"It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that

Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that

Did I misread the sign?
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that

You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said,
""Well, I wasn't expecting that""

I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?

I wasn't expecting that
It was only a word
It was almost misheard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that

I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed

If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
And I wasn't expecting that
And when the nurses they came
Said its come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"

Truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful
'Cause I'm counting on

A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly
In the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven
And make you want to cry

The tears of joy for all the pleasure
And the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort
And protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can you see it baby?
Don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you

749,David Gray,This Year's Love,"This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
And I've been waiting on my own too long
But when you hold me like you do
It feels so right
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on

Turning circles and time again
It cuts like a knife oh now
If you love me got to know for sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last

So who's to worry?
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on?
And won't you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing 'ain't this life so sweet'

This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last"
750,Lukas Graham,7 Years,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

751,Robbie Williams,Angels,"I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold

So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead"
752,Phil Collins,Another Day In Paradise,"She calls out to the man on the street
""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep.
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, mmm hmm
Think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
Paradise
Just think about it
Paradise
Just think about
Paradise
Paradise

And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go

Funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe

But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun

Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?

760,Kelly Clarkson,Because of You,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"
761,Sting,Fields Of Gold,"You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in fields of gold

So she took her love for to gaze a while
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold"

If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeaheah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one, yeaheaheah

So incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far

'Cause you know that you got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just till the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one"
763,Adele,Hello,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart

765,Lionel Richie,Stuck On You,"Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time, little darling, I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed"
766,Damien Rice,The Blower's Daughter,"And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?

I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind... my mind

769,Elton John,Candle In The Wind,"Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid

Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did"
770,Beyoncé,Heaven,"I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

So go on, go home

To the way you look

To the break of day

And hold you forever

Girl when I'm with you
I lose track of time
When I'm without you
You're stuck on my mind

I'll be all you need
Until the day that I die
I'll love you
Over and over again

Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

Let's make love tonight

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby, ohhh
Come take control, just grab ahold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate

Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
It's pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart (thief of the heart)
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

It's pullin' me back (just a little more time)

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby..."

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?

780,Earth Wind & Fire,After the Love Has Gone,"For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last 
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
Till sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love into

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much

But I'll be left here waiting
With my Heart on my sleeve

Seems like a million years and I think I'm dying

But my will is getting stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you
So next time you find
You wanna leave her bed for mine

Why don't you stay, I'm up of my knees

785,Peabo Bryson,Tonight I Celebrate My Love,"Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, tonight"
786,U2,Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of,"I'm not afraid of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just tryin' to find a decent melody
A song that I can sing in my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling, look at you
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it

I will not forsake the colours that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me
I still listen through your ears and through your eyes I can see

You are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough and you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now, my oh my

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it
Oh, love, look at you now
You got yourself stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it

I was unconscious, half asleep
The water is warm till you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothin' at all
Oh, yeah yeah

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it

And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along that stony pass

And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along that stony pass
It's just a moment, this time will pass"
787,Randy Crawford,One Day I'll Fly Away,"I make it alone
When love is gone
Still you made your mark
Here in my heart

One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me

I follow the night
Can't stand the light
When will I begin
My life again

One Day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me
Why live life from dream to dream
And dread the day that dreaming ends

One day I'll fly away leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me
Why live life from dream to dream 
And dread the day that dreaming ends

One day I'll fly away, fly away, fly away"
788,Bryan Ferry,Slave to Love,"Tell her I'll be waiting in the usual place
With the tired and weary and there's no escape
To need a woman you've got to know
How the strong get weak and the rich get poor

Slave to love
Oho
Slave to love

You're running with me
Don't touch the ground
We're the restless hearted
Not the chained and bound

The sky is burning
A sea of flame
Though your world is changing
I will be the same

Slave to love
Oho
Slave to love

Slave to love (Nananana)
Oho (Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

The storm is breaking or so it seems
We're too young to reason, too grown up to dream
Now spring is turning your face to mine
I can hear your laughter, I can see your smile

Slave to love (Nananana)
Oho (Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

Slave to love (Nananana)
Oho (Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love"
789,Barry White,Can't Get Enough Of Your Love Babe,"I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no
But I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough
Oh oh, babe
Oh babe

Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe

Lord some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're near
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling I
I can't get enough of your love ,babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much, girl you're so unreal
Still, I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do because you've blown my mind

I get the same old feelin' every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

790,Leonard Cohen,Darkness,"I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
Drinking from your cup
I said ""Is this contagious?""
You said ""Just drink it up""

I got no future
I know my days are few
I know the present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I should have seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the prize

I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey, I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
I loved the early morning
And I'd pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness, baby
And I got it worse than you

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
Drinking from your cup
I said ""Is this contagious?""
You said ""Just drink it up"""

A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a short cut I'd have found it
But there is no easy way around it.

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by
Tell me is it worth just another try

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Tell me, are we alive
Or just a dying planet?
What are the chances?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers

And when you feel afraid
Love one another
When you've lost your way
Love one another
And when you're all alone
Love one another
And when you're far from home
Love one another
And when you're down and out
Love one another
And when your hopes run out
Love one another
And when you need a friend
Love one another
And when you're near the end
Love, we got to love,
We got to love one another

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer"

Not much how 'bout you?
I'm not sure why I called
Guess I really just wanted to talk to you

And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for awhile
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile

I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

We could walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay a home and watch TV
You see it really doesn't matter much to me

I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I won't ask for promises
So you won't have to lie
We've both played this game before
Say I love you
Say goodbye

I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life

And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you, waiting for you"
801,James Taylor,Fire And Rain,"Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought they would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Fire and rain, now"

I have to smile myself
Because I love you
And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby
I don't know

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
If it grows stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

I thought I was in love a couple of times before
With the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you

And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Sent down to break my heart

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
If it grows stronger every day, yeah
How much longer?

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today"

I'll only start repeating myself
And all I can say is 
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

If I slip and tip my hand
I'm certain to scare you away
Then what would I say
I'd be hurting I'm certain
I'd be uncool to let you know that you're the one
The fool who jumped the gun

'Cause I've been advised by other guys
You've left behind
Your goodbyes are somewhat unrefined
But if I play my role just right
Tonight could be my lucky night
And you could be mine

If I present it to you
With a flower in the moonlight
Shiny and new
Well, you couldn't say no tonight
If I keep my heart out of sight

If I play my role just right
Then Tonight could be my lucky night

I hope that you will understand
I say these things 'cause I'd like to know
If you're as lonely as I am and if you'd mind
Sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night

We could bring in the morning girl
If you want to go that far
And if tomorrow find us together
Right here the way we are would you mind
Sharing the night together

Oh-yeah, sharing the night

Would you like to dance with me and hold me
You know I want to be holding you
Ah-yeah, alright
'Cause I like feeling like I do
And I see in your eyes that you're liking it
I'm liking it too
Ah-yeah, alright

Like to get to know you better
Is there a place where we can go
Where we can be alone together

Who will understand what you're going through
When it comes to love, there's no easy answer
Only you can say what you're gonna do

I heard you on the phone, you took his number
Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
Isn't he the guy, the guy who left you cryin'?
Isn't he the one who made you blue?

When you remember those nights in his arms
You know you gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you goin' back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

What you gonna say when he comes over?
Ther's no easy way to see this through
All the broken dreams, all the disappointment
Oh girl, what you gonna do?

Your heart keeps sayin' it's just not fair
But still you gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you goin' back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above"

Believe me

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free"
808,Christopher Cross,Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do) - Remastered,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ...
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ...
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ...
The best that you can do is fall in love"

I was a girl
Who trusted no one with my heart
And the dreams that young girls dream
Were just vanishing in the dark
But now I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
They say

That I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else
In my heart but you
And I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you

Now my touch belongs to you
And I will always be your best friend
Now my secrets are safe with you
And the magic will never end
Now you are the one
And heaven will only know

Hey yeah, when you think of Laura but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

A friend of a friend, a friend till the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away without a warning

Think of Laura but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
Hey yeah, when you think of Laura but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

I know you and you're here
In every day we live
I know her and well, she's here
I can feel her when I sing

Hey Laura, (Laura) where are you now
Are you far away from here
I don't think so
I think you're here
Taking our tears away

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Time can never mend

I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend

And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

That you had to leave me alone?"

No one else will do

And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever (ooh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love (oh, love)
I'll be a fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

Because you
You mean the world to me, oh
I know, I know
I've found in you
My endless love

Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, booom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Ooh, and love, oh, love
I'll be that fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know I don't mind

And, yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside

And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless love"
813,Lionel Richie,Hello,"I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

But I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you"
814,Lionel Richie;Darius Rucker,Stuck On You,"Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time, little darling, I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed"
815,Lionel Richie;Kenny Rogers,Lady,"Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you
You have made me what I am, and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways I want to say, I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love,
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song

Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever, let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

Lady, your love's the only love I need,
And beside me is where I want you to be
'Cause my love, there's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life; you're my lady"
816,Kenny Rogers,Through The Years,"I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years
Through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad
To be with you
Through the years
It's better every day
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years
When everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belonged
Right here with you
Through the years
I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out
I've learned what life's about
By loving you
Through the years

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
It's better every day
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you
Through the years"
817,Kenny Rogers,She Believes in Me,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me"
818,Kenny Rogers,You Decorated My Life,"All my life was a paper
Once plain, pure and white
'Til you moved with your pen
Changing moods now and then
'Til the balance was right
Then you added some music
Every note was in place
And anybody could see
All the changes in me
By the look on my face

And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By painting your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony
Life meant nothin' to me
Until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see
All the things life can be
Shining soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By painting your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life"
819,Kenny Rogers,Desperado,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh and you're a hard one, but I know that you've got your reasons
The things that are pleasin' you, can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, she'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get.

Desperado, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone.

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
And you're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences- open the gates
It may be rainin, but there's a rainbow above you
You'd better let somebody love you, let somebody love you.

You'd better let somebody love you
Before it's too late..."
820,Kenny Rogers,You Are So Beautiful,"You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see
You're everything that I'd hoped for
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful to me

You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me 
Can't you see
You're everything that I'd hoped for
You're everything that I need
You are so beautiful
You are so beautiful
You are so beautiful to me"
821,Kenny Loggins,Heart to Heart,"You ain't crazy
I ain't gonna lie anymore
What you're feelin'
There's a reason for
I wanna do right
Oh, gotta do right

Do I love you, oh
You know I've tried
But what you're after
You can't find in my eyes
I'm gonna do right

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
This is our last chance
To touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

One by one
We're collecting lies
When you can't give love
You give alibis
Now, I'm gonna do right
This time I got to do right

I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna say goodbye
Sooner or later, honey
There comes a time
Mama, when you gotta do right
Come on, come on

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
From this one last chance to
Touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

Why are you so torn apart
I need a little more
Loving in my heart
People say that love will grow
So how was I to know
Love that's come
Through years and years
Can't find a way
Back home anymore

Darlin'
Tell me the truth
Don't turn away
This is our final chance to
Touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
(So darlin' tell me)
Maybe we're near the end
So, darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know but
But maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So, darling, oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart"
822,Kenny Loggins,For the First Time,"Are those your eyes, is that your smile?
I've been looking at you forever, but I never saw you before
Are these your hands holding mine?
Now I wonder how I could have been so blind

For the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me...
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the First Time

Can this be real? Can this be true?
Am I the person I was this mornin' and are you the same you?
It's all so strange... how can it be?
All along this love was right in front of me

For the first time... I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I am seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the First time

Such a long time ago I had given up on finding this emotion ever again
But you're here with me now
Yes, I found you somehow
And I've never been so sure

And for the first time
I am looking in your eyes
For the first time, I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me

Now I understand what love is, love is
For The First Time..."
823,Barry Manilow,I Write The Songs,"I've been alive forever
And I wrote the very first song
I put the words and the melodies together
I am music and I write the songs

I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

My home lies deep within you
And I've got my own place in your soul
Now when I look out through your eyes
I'm young again even though I'm very old

I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

Oh, my music makes you dance 
And gives you spirit to take a chance
And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move
Music fills your heart
Well, that's a real fine place to start
It's from me, it's for you, it's from you, it's for me
It's a worldwide symphony

I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

I am music and I write the songs"
824,Cliff Richard,Ocean Deep - 2002 Remastered Version,-1
825,Bread,Make It With You,"Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows
But, baby, here goes

Dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wondering what this song is leading to
I want to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Though you don't know me well
In every little thing only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
Then we'll see it through

Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Baby, you know that
Dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life, it's for us to keep
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl"
826,Bread,Everything I Own,"You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much 
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again"
827,Bread,If,"If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show 
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away"
828,Bread,Diary,"I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words she'd written took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes
They said that she had found
The love she'd waited for
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it

When she confronted with the writing there
Simply pretended not to care
I passed it off as just in keeping with
Her total disconcerting air
And though she tried to hide
The love that she denied
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will give to her my wife
All the sweet things I can find

I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words began to stick and tears to flow
Her meaning now was clear to see
The love she'd waited for
Was someone else not me
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will wish for her his wife
All the sweet things she can find
All the sweet things they can find"
829,Bread,Aubrey,"And Aubrey was her name
A not so very ordinary girl or name
But who's to blame?
For a love that wouldn't bloom
For the hearts that never played in tune
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing
Take away the words that rhyme, it doesn't mean a thing

And Aubrey was her name
We tripped the light and danced together to the moon
But where was June?
No, it never came around
If it did it never made a sound
Maybe I was absent or was listening too fast
Catching all the words but then the meaning going past

But God I miss the girl
And I'd go a thousand times around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me

And Aubrey was her name
I never knew her but I loved her just the same
I loved her name
Wish that I had found the way
And the reasons that would make her stay
I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest
If I can't have the one I want, I'll do without the best

But how I miss the girl
And I'd go a million times around the world just to say
She had been mine for a day"
830,Little River Band,Cool Change,"If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

There's lots of those friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
But I never want to lose their inspiration

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
And now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales, they are my brothers

It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air
Yeah, yeah
Let me breathe the air

If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

It's kind of a special feeling
Out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool, cool, cool change

(Time for a cool change)
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
For a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Ooh, I know it's time for a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Now that my life is so prearranged
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
(Time for a cool change)
It's time for a cool change
Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is
You know it's time for a cool change"
831,America,All My Life,"All my life, without a doubt I give you
All my life, now and forever till the
Day I die, you and I will share

All the things this changing world can offer
So I sing, I'd be happy just to
Stay this way, spend each day, with you

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line

It would have passed away
It would have passed away
It would have passed away

All my life, I will carry you through
All my life, between each hour of the passing days
I will stay with you

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line

I want this all my life
I want this all my life
I want this all my life
I want this all my life
I want this all my life
I have wanted this all my life"
832,Dan Fogelberg,Longer,"Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We'll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years, as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with you"

The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know, everywhere I go
You're always on my mind
In my heart, in my soul, baby

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me, say it
No one needs you more than I need you

We're so in love when we're together
And I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

835,Don McLean,Vincent,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for
One as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"
836,Don McLean,And I Love You So,"And I love you so,
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now
I tell them ""I don't know""

I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my belief

And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening bring me down
Now that you're around me

And I love you so
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now
I tell them ""I don't know"""
837,Jim Croce,Time in a Bottle,"If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with"
838,Jim Croce,I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song,"Well, I know it's kinda late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I've gotta say can't wait
I know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kinda strange
But every time I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Every time the time was right
All the words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kinda late
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just gotta say
Know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song"
839,Jim Croce,Photographs And Memories,"Photographs and memories
Christmas cards you sent to me
All that I have are these to remember you
Memories that come at night
Take me to another time
Back to a happier day, when I called you mine

But we sure had a good time
When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks
Oh, how I loved you then

Summer skies and lullabies
Nights we couldn't say goodbye
And of all of the things that we knew
Not a dream survived

Photographs and memories
All the love you gave to me
Somehow it just can't be true
It's all I've left of you

But we sure had a good time
When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks
Oh, how I loved you then"
840,Bee Gees,How Deep Is Your Love (2007 Remastered Saturday Night Fever LP Version),"Ah

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be

We'll walk a while, we'll talk a while
Feel my love, always there beside you
Be the one

You are the one I cherish more than anything

I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever see
More than my heart could ever show
I love you more than you'll ever know

Think of me
And know that I'll believe in you
There'll always be this precious time together
With every tear
A love so strong, no words could ever say
A love to last forever

I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever see
More than my heart could ever show
I love you more than you'll ever know

Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a-flutter

But another lonely night
Might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, love
'Cause I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

Yes, I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching sea birds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some time
Maybe all we need is time...
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life

It's you, It's you
I've been waiting for all of my life
Maybe it's you (It's you), maybe it's you (It's you)

847,Michael Martin Murphey,What's Forever For,"I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me that's gone crazy
But I can't understand out why
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever For

I see love hungry people
Tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And their not even tryin' to keep it alive

So, what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for

So, what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for"

Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy

And soon she'll be by
Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing
To give us another try
And if all those plans I made
Don't melt the lady's heart
I'll put on the old forty-fives
And maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
And maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry
And wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay

It's been too long without seeing her face light up
When I come home
Been too many hours I've waited
Staring at the phone
Sweet old songs, I'm countin' on you
Bring her back to me
I'm tired of listening alone

Maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
And maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry
And wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay

And make her wanna stay

While the lights are right 
I'll never let you go 

Did I dream that we danced forever 
In a wish that we made together 
On a night that I prayed would never end? 

You know it's not my imagination 
Or a part of the orchestration 
Love was here at the coronation 
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts 

Time will pass and tears will fall 
But someday we'll both recall 
Moments made of this 
Golden memories

On a night that I prayed would never end? (END) 

No, it's not my imagination

Trust in love to faith, 
Findin' out too late that they've lost it; 
Never leting go, 
They will never know the ways of love.

In a world that's full of strangers; 
You've got to believe in magic, 
Somethin' stronger than the moon above

I may never know  
Why I need you so, 
All I need to know is this feeling; 
Handle it with care,

855,Billy Dean,I Can't Find The Words To Say Goodbye,"(Billy Dean/David Gates)

I can't say I don't love her
Still I can't pretend
My heart is torn just knowing that
I'm losing my best friend
If it's easier said than done
Then someone tell me why
Though I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I can tell her that I'm sorry
And hope she'll understand
And she'll have to do with someone else
All that we had planned
I'd rather her hear the truth
Than hurt her with a lie
So I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I know I have to go
There's no other way
But goodbye is not what I
Can bring myself to say

I tell her ""see you later""
But then I might be wrong
This voice inside is driving me
To find where I belong
I know I must leave her now
Everytime I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye
Don't know why
I can't find the words to say goodbye"

857,James Ingram,There's No Easy Way,"I held her close to me
'Cause I know she breaks so easily
And then I told her
But I knew no matter how I tried to console her
She'd just do the best she could
But there are times the best in no damn good
And no matter how you try to be kind
There's always still a part of you you leave behind
When it falls apart

Chorus: There's no easy way to break somebody's heart

I lied and told her she'd be fine
Though we both knew it was just a line
I had to do it
'Cause I'd a' said anything to help me get through it

Then she reached out for my hand
And her simple touch was more than I could stand
And I had to turn away
'Cause I knew all the hurt
That she was feeling I was feeling too
'Cause when it falls apart

There's no easy way to break somebody's heart

She could've gotten angry
And made me feel like a guilty child
But I realized that never was her style
I wanted her to hurt me
And not treat me like a friend
I wanted her to say there'd be someday
I'm come crawling on my knees to ask her back again
But she acted like a lady till the end
Oh, what a lady

I thought that she'd break down
But she smiled at me and never made a sound
And I guess she understood in her way
Cause her silence told me everything she could not say
When it falls apart
There's just no easy way

There's just no easy way
There's just no easy way to break somebody's heart."

And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I say there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore

I used to thank the lord when I'd wake
For life and love and the golden sky above me
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin'
You see in my dreams you love me 

Daybreak is a joyful time
Just listen to the songbird harmonies, oh the harmonies
But I wish the dawn would never come
I wish there was silence in the trees, oh the trees
If only I could stay asleep, at least I could pretend you're thinkin' of me
'Cause night time is the one time I am happy
You see in my dreams... 

We climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
And I don't know really what it means
All I know is that you love me, in my dreams 

I keep hopin' one day I'll awaken, and somehow she'll be lying by my side
And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin'
She touches me and suddenly I'm alive 

We climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
And I don't know really what it means
All I know is that you love me, in my dreams

We're after the same rainbow's end, waiting, round the bend

It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live

But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve

But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover, I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know, I know

When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone

But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
'Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you"
864,Simon & Garfunkel,The Sound of Silence,"Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell

And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"
865,Angela Bofill,You Should Know by Now,"You ought to know by now
Love is the look in my eye
Lovin' the way you smile when I say
""I wish you would stay.""
You bring out all the youth in me
I laugh and cry out all the truth in me
Out o' love.
You should know by now

Haven't you felt by now?
Just what it's like to be loved
Knowin' that certain touch when you're sure
Time won't give you more
You bring out all the best in me
I wanna hold you till you feel the need somehow
You should know by now

If I could just find the words
I wouldn't be left so lonely
I'm your one, my only
Then I'd show you how
Every move as smooth as silk
Say you will; say you will

Hasn't it crossed your mind?
Haven't you known all the time?
Honestly tell me now
Has it shown?
How much love is grown?
The way I tremble at the sight of you
I want to learn to love you through and through
This I'll beg
You should know by now
Hmm-mmm

By now
You should know by now
Don't you think you should know by now?
Ooh"

In this crazy world
You're everything I've tried to find

You're my Mona Lisa
You're my rainbow skies
And my only prayer is that you realize...
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

The world will turn
And the seasons will change
And all the lessons we will learn
Will be beautiful and strange
We'll have our fill of tears
Our share of sighs
My only prayer is that you realize...
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be
Beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes

And there are lines upon my face
From a lifetime of smiles
When the time comes to embrace
For one long last while
We can laugh about
How time really flies
We won't say good-bye
Cause' true love never dies...
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be (You will always be)
Beautiful in my eyes (Beautiful in my eyes)
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes

The passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes"
867,Patti Austin,If I Believed,"If I believed in paradise
I'd swear I must be there
I'd swear I must be there right now with you
If I believed in miracles
I'd know that one was happening to me
But if I don't believe in paradise
And miracles aren't real
Then someone tell me
What is this I feel
I wanna believe it's love this time
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me a lie
But with you I can't deny
That if I believed in paradise
I'd swear I'm there
If I believed in magic spells
It all would be so clear
A magic spell must have brought you here
If I could see the future
I'd see if you and I were meant to be
But I don't know any magic
And tomorrow's just a dream
Then something in this fantasy is real
I wanna believe it's love this time
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me a lie
I wanna believe it's love
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me a lie
But with you I can't deny
That if I believed in paradise
I'd swear I'm there
I'm there
I'm there
If I believed"
868,Kenny Rankin,What Matters Most,"It's not how long we held each other's hand
What matters is how well we loved each other
It's not how far we travelled on our way
Of what we found to say
It's not the spring you see, but all the shades of green

It's not how long I held you in my arms
What matters is how sweet the years together
It's not how many summertimes we had to give to fall
The early morning smiles we tearfully recall
What matters most is that we loved at all.

It's not how many summertimes we had to give to fall
The early morning smiles we tearfully recall
What matters most is that we loved at all.

What matters most is that we loved at all."
869,John Denver,Annie's Song,"You fill up my senses
Like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain

Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again

Come let me love you
Let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter
Let me die in your arms

Let me lay down beside you
Let me always be with you
Come let me love you
Come love me again

Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you
Come love me again

You fill up my senses
Like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain

Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again"

871,Tiffany,It's The Lover (Not The Love),"He broke your heart and said goodbye
After promising forever
You wonder why you even tried
He was such a good pretender
The love you gave was all in vain
But nothing anyone can say
Could ever make you love that way again

It's the lover not the love
Who broke your heart last night
It's the lover not the dream
That didn't work out right
Of you listen to your heart
Oh, you'll know it's true
It's the lover not the love
Who deserted you

Don't stop reaching for the stars
Let tomorrow live inside you
And just remember who you are
Keep the faith and love will find you
A heart in love can lose, it's true
But don't give up in time you'll find
The one who's right will come to you

It's the lover not the love
Who broke your heart last night
It's the lover not the dream
That didn't work out right
Of you listen to your heart
Oh, you'll know it's true
It's the lover not the love
Who deserted you

It doe no good to second guess
Whether love is wrong or right
If it was really meant to be,
He'd be with you tonight, tonight

It's the lover not the love
Who broke your heart last night
It's the lover not the dream
That didn't work out right
Of you listen to your heart
Oh, you'll know it's true
It's the lover not the love
Who deserted you"

The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside 
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lying here next to you 
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try

Oh, sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside 
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I've got
Your love has captured me

The closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me
(Me too)
Falling closer, sweet as the gravity

The closer I get (to you)"

879,Larry Graham,One In A Million You,"Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in
Said you can't win

But one day the sun came a-shining through
The rain had stopped, and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying ""I love you"" to me

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
A one in a million you

I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill
Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth living again
For to love you to me is to live

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
A one in a million you

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
One in a million you

A one in a million you"
880,Debbie Gibson,Lost In Your Eyes,"I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can let go

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation is worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
Oh it's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes"
881,Gloria Estefan;Miami Sound Machine,Anything for You,"Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years

Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye"
882,Dan Seals,One Friend,"I always thought you were the best 
I guess I always will. 
I always thought that we were blessed 
And I feel that way still. 
Sometimes we took the hard road 
But we always saw it through. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you. 

Sometimes the world was on our side 
Sometimes it wasn't fair. 
Sometimes it gave a helping hand 
Sometimes we didn't care. 

'Cause when we were together 
It made the dream come true. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you. 

Someone who understands me 
And knows me inside out. 
Helps keep me together 
And believes without a doubt, 
That I could move a mountain 
Someone to tell it to. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you. 

Someone 
And knows me inside out.

Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch when you are sleeping, you belong with me
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (burning) an eternal flame?

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feeling, oh

Say my name

884,Patti Austin,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,"They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I ofcourse reply
Something inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them
And I gayly laughed
To think they could doubt
To think they could doubt my love

But today
My love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes

But today my love has flown away
I am without
I'm without my love

And now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes"
885,David Soul,Don't give up on us,"Don't give up on us, baby
Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer 
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby"
886,Patti Austin,In My Life,"Although music is sweet
But the song incomplete
Now in my life,
Boy in my life

It's the truth, yes it's true
Still there's no me and you
Here in my life
Boy in my life
Something is missing

In my life there ain't no melody oh no
In my life there ain't no harmony
To let me sing a song

All I need is a cue when I'm waiting for you here in my life
Boy in my life
You are the melody
'Cause in my life
You are the song

Uh oh
In my life there ain't no melody oh no
In my life there ain't no harmony to let me sing a song
All I need is a cue while I'm waiting for you here in my life
Boy in my life
You are the melody
'Cause in my life
You are the song
Baby in my life
You are the song
You are the melody
To me baby, in my life
You are my song"
887,Survivor,Ever Since the World Began,"I'll never know what brought me here,
As if somebody led my hand,
It seems I hardly had to steer,
My course was planned.
And destiny it guides us all,
And by it's hand we rise and fall,
But only for a moment,
Time enough to catch our breath again.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
How one live touches the other,
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together,
We travel through as far as we can,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.

Taking in the times gone by,
We wonder how it all began,
We'll never know and still we
Try to understand.
And even though the seasons change,
The reasons shall remain the same,
It's love that keeps us holding on
Till we can see the sun again.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.

And I stand alone, a man of stone,
Against the driving rain,
And the night it's got your number,
And the wind it cries your name,
If we search for truth, win or lose,
In this we're all the same,
The hope still burns eternal,
We're the keeper of the flame.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
How one live touches the other,
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together,
We try and go as far as we can,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began."
888,Stephen Bishop,Separate Lives,"You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance with someone that you'd met
And telling me how sorry you were, leavin' so soon
And that you miss me sometimes, when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on, just holding on to time
So for now, we'll go on living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, you never let it show, oh no
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living - now we're living - separate lives

Ooh, it's so difficult, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall - you build that wall
Yes you build that wall - oh yes, you build that wall
And you make it stronger - no

You have no right to ask me how I feel - oh no
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might - I just might - find myself looking in your eyes
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Ooh, separate lives"
889,George Benson,Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You,"If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever, oh, so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more then your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you
If you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Ooh, doo doo doo doo, oh oh oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

890,Whitney Houston,Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of me and you

We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we almost have it all"
891,Chris de Burgh,The Lady In Red,"I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight
I never will forget
The way you look tonight

The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red

I love you"
892,Dianne Reeves,Better Days,"Better days

Silver gray hair neatly combed in place.
There were four generations of love on her face.
She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes,
She'd seen it all.

I was a child, oh, about three or four.
All day I'd ask questions.
At night I'd ask more.
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong?
And why does what I want always take so long?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me?

I'd say, Grandma what is love?
Will I ever find out?
Why are we so poor, what is life about?
I wanna know the answers before I fall off to sleep.

She sort of smiled as she tucked me in.
Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again.
But tonight she was slightly, remarkably
Different somehow

Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep.
Grandma yawned as she stretched.
Then she started to speak.
What she told me, would mold me, and hold me
Together inside.

She said all the things you ask
You will know someday.
But you have got to live in a patient way.
God put us here by fate
And by fate that means better days.

She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night.
Ain't no morning gonna come till the time is right.
Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night.
You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.

You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night.
Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
(Be patient) oh baby, be patient.

Later that year, at the turn of spring,
Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings.
Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding
In better days

And although I'm all grown up
I still get confused.
I stumble through the dark
Getting bumped and bruised.
When night gets in my way
I could still hear my Grandma say
I can hear her say,
I can hear her say.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night baby.
(Be patient) Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
Child, do you hear me, yeah.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it, you got to make it
You got to make it
You got to make it through the night

(Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma
Do you see me now, lady
Oh oh oh oh oh...

(Be patient) She used to sit me on her knee
She used to comb my hair
She used to tell me stories...
My Grandma took me everywhere"
893,John Farnham,Please Don't Ask Me,"Please don't ask me what am I thinking
It's about you
And please don't ask me
I never can see you
What can I do
My first impulse is to run to your side
My heart's not free, and so I must hide
Please don't ask me
What I'm gonna say to you
I toss and turn
Can't sleep at night
It's worrying me, I go to bed
Turn out the light
But your face I see
It only hurts
The more I pretend
That we could ever
Be more than friends
Please don't ask me
Why I'm so in love with you
You could easily make me happy
That I know
But I try my best to never tell you so
I will sing to you my love songs
And pretend And I'll keep the secret right down
To the end
Please don't ask me why I'm not talking
I just can't explain
And please don't ask me
Why I go walking out in the rain
I could not live the lie it would take
To have you here would be a mistake
Please don't ask me
Why I'm still in love with you
No please don't ask me"

I may
Find true love that will last forever
And ever

Till then
I'll spend
A lifetime of wishing us together
I never thought she'd say goodbye
And I'll never understand
The reasons why

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing
Heart of mine
Oh what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Love plays
Cruel games
I can't believe she's found another
To love her

Does she
Miss me
Sometimes I just can't help but wonder
If I could stop the hands of time
Then I'd know she'd always be
Forever mine

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing
Heart of mine
Oh what's the the use in trying
No one can mend you now"

That I'll have your heart for always
And you want me by your side
Whispering the words, ""I'll always love you.""

And forever
I will be your lover
And I know if you really care
I will always be there

Now, I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy my heart and soul can give

Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever

Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you girl
I'm truly head over heels with your love
I need you
And with your love I'm free
And truly
You know you're alright with me"

I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love on stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but, darling, can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darling, can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine

We were alone and I was singing this song for you"

David Slater
(David Slater)

One-sided love broke the see-saw down
I got to get rough when I hear the grudge
And you went your way and I went wild
And girl, you'd understand if your heart was mine

If we had an exchange of hearts
Then you'd know why I fell apart
You'd feel the pain when the mem'ries start
If we had an exchange of hearts

I'd never wished a lonely heart on you
It's not your fault, I chose to play the fool
One day may come when you'll be in my shoes
Then your heart will break and you'll feel just like I do

If we had an exchange of hearts
Then you'd know why I fell apart
You'd feel the pain when the mem'ries start
If we had an exchange of hearts

When time turns the tables and soon I'll be able
To find a new romance
And then you'll remember my love warm and tender
Too late for a second chance

(Instrumental)

If we had an exchange of hearts
Then you'd know why I fell apart
You'd feel the pain when the mem'ries start
If we had an exchange of hearts

There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

My first love,
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I
I-I-I-I-I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do...

And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever
Oh
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
Oh, love
I'll be a fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

Cause you,
You mean the world to me, Oh
I know
I know
I've found in you
My endless love

Ooh-woow
Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Ooh, and love
Oh, love
I'll be that fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know-
I don't mind

And, yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause NO one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you

I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls

And when (and when) there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care

My love won't age at all

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one, yeaheaheah

So incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far

'Cause you know that you got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true

If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just till the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you

915,Whitney Houston,Greatest Love Of All,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place

Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Try as I may, I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

All day long, I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd 
Try as they may, they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

Oh
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

(You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all)

That smile on your face
The truth in your eyes
The touch of your hand
Lets me know that you need me
(You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all)"
921,Shania Twain,You're Still The One,"Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together still goin' strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

You're still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby"
922,Extreme,More Than Words,"Saying ""I love you""
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you""

La-di-da-da-di-da-di-da-da-da
More than words
La-di-da-di-da

Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

923,Alicia Keys,No One,"I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you"
924,The Bangles,Eternal Flame,"Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch when you are sleeping, you belong with me
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (burning) an eternal flame?

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feeling, oh

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely

925,Stevie Wonder,I Just Called To Say I Love You,"No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, it's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though oh, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
I just called (just called) to say (to say) how much I care, I do
I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, baby of my heart"
926,Sixpence None The Richer,Kiss Me,"Kiss me, out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken treehouse
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hair
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me"
927,Natalie Imbruglia,Torn,"I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now

I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn
Torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late 
I'm already torn
Torn (oh)

(Oh yeah, a little)
(Oh yeah, a little)
(Oh yeah, a little)"
928,Take That,Back for Good - Radio Mix,-1
929,Roxette,It Must Have Been Love,"Must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love, but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

(Must have been love) It must have been love
But it's over now
No, no, no"
930,Cyndi Lauper,Time After Time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time"
931,Toni Braxton,Un-Break My Heart,"Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart

Take back that sad word, ""goodbye""
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

Oh, un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights

Oh, un-break my, un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on

932,Elton John,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best"
933,Christina Aguilera,I Turn to You,"When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way

When I'm scared
Losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around

And when I'm down you're there
Pushing me to the top
You're always there
Giving me all you've got

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you

For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you, yeah

Oh, when I lose the will to win
I just reach to you
And I can reach the sky again

I can do anything
'Cause your love is so amazing
'Cause your love inspires me

And when I need a friend
You're always on my side
Giving me faith
Taking me through the night

(For a shield) For a shield (From the storm) from the storm
(For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm) For a love to keep me safe and warm
(I turn to you) I turn to you

(For the strength) For the strength (To be strong)
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
I turn to you, yeah, ohoho

For the arms to be my shelter
Through all the rain
For truth that will never change
For someone to lean on

For a heart I can rely on through anything
For the one who I can run to!
Ohoho, ah

For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm) To keep me safe and warm, yeaheah

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey, I love you
Never again to be all alone

'Cause you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

'Cause you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you, you light up my life"
940,Barbra Streisand;Bryan Adams,I Finally Found Someone (Duet with Bryan Adams),"I finally found someone, it knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete
We started over coffee, we started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin

This time it's different
It's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it through
Ooh, my favorite line was ""Can I call you sometime?""
It's all you had to say to take my breath away

This is it!
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone, ooh, someone
I finally found someone, ooh

Did I keep you waiting, I didn't mind
I apologize, baby, that's fine
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
And I love your hair, sure it looks right?
I love what you wear, isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional, I can't wait for the rest of my life

This is it!
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone, ooh, someone
I finally found someone, ooh

And whatever I do, it's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone"
941,Michael Bublé,The Way You Look Tonight,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fears apart...
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely ... Never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fears apart...
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely ... Never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.

Mm, tonight."
942,Whitney Houston,I Will Always Love You,"If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my darling you, mmm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you, yeah, yeah

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you
Darling, I love you
I'll always, I'll always love you"

945,Bette Midler,Wind Beneath My Wings,"Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh and I, I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away
You let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you
The wind beneath my wings"
946,Carpenters,(They Long To Be) Close To You,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Everytime you are near?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Everytime you walk by?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (all around)
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

947,Carpenters,We've Only Just Begun,"We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way 
(We've only begun)

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run
(And yes we've just begun)

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
(And yes we've just begun)

Sharing horizons that are new to us

948,Carpenters,Top Of The World,"Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees
And the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be
Just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?

I'm on the top of the world

Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?"
949,Carpenters,Yesterday Once More,"When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile

Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more

(Shoobidoo, lailai)
(Shoobidoo, lailai)

Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
(All the oldies but goodies)
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
(Shoobidoo, lailai)

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine"

956,Whitney Houston,I Have Nothing,"Share my life
Take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing
Nothing
Nothing, if I don't have you (you-ooh, you-ooh, you)

You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love
Uh, I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will our memories survive?
Uh, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow
I'm holdin' back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
You're the love I remember forever

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing
Nothing, nothing

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?

Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing
Nothing
Nothing, if I don't have you
You, if I don't have you"
957,Whitney Houston,Saving All My Love for You,"A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist
Being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night
For feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night 
That I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For you"
958,Whitney Houston,Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of me and you

We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we almost have it all"
959,Whitney Houston,Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"I know it's been sometime
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day

We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me, ooh baby

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away

And what we had was so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know, oh

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

For me
You still care for me"
960,Whitney Houston,All The Man That I Need,"Ooh

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same
It's not the same

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got
He's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
He won't let go

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

He fills me up (he fills me up)
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got (he's all I got)
He's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need
 (All the man, all the man I need)

He fills me up (he fills me up)
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got (he's all I got)
He's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

961,Whitney Houston,One Moment in Time,"Each day I live, I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one, but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown

I broke my heart, for every gain
To taste the sweet, I face the pain
I rise and fall, yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance, here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free

Oh, you're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time, moment in time

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free
Oh, I will feel, I will be free"
962,Whitney Houston,Run to You,"Ooh, I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl, who's scared sometimes 
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night, I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh woah, what's the sense 
Of trying hard to find your dreams?
Without someone to share them with
Tell me, what does it mean?

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?
Run away

No, I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
No, if you only knew 
How much I wanna run to you
Know I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?"
963,Whitney Houston;Mariah Carey,When You Believe,"Many nights we prayed, with no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts, a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid, although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could

Oh yes, there can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe, mmm, yeah

Ohh, in this time of fear, when prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds, too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here, my heart so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (Mmm)

Who knows what miracles you can achieve? (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will, you will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
Ohh, but when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still resilient voice says hope is very near 

There can be miracles
Miracles
When you believe
Boy, when you believe, ohh
Though hope is frail, it's hard...
Hard to kill, yeah

Who knows what miracles you can achieve? 
You can achieve, ohh
When you believe, somehow you will
Somehow, somehow, somehow

Somehow you will
I know, I know, know
You will when you believe
When you believe...

Ohh, you will when you...
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will, you will
Just believe
You will when you believe"

965,Air Supply,All Out of Love,"I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life feels so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh, so right?

And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please, love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

Oh, what are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?

I know just when to face the truth

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

(Note: These italicized lyrics only appear on the demo recording sung by Rory Dodd)
I can make your money double
Or I can make you lose your shirt
I can make your old wounds start to heal
Or I can make the new ones hurt

I can make the music louder
Or I can make the songs all fade
I can make every girl just wanna get up and dance
And make the boys in the band start to play

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

And you don't care for much but I'm not letting go

Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy, you'll want to carry on (Carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much

Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me oh oh oh

It can drag you down
Till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't know what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me oh oh oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl

Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are

As high as the highest star

Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own, I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you

Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without, go on without

You couldn't hurt me bad enough to make me give it up and walk away

**We can't stop the feeling's too strong
We've got the will to hang on
Can't stop we struggle and fight to survive
Just keeping the love alive

Try to forget the past so many times it's hard to make those mem'ries leave

I know the girl sees things
Nobody else can see
All of the secret fears inside
And all the craziness I hide
She looks into my soul
And reads me like nobody can
And she doesn't judge the man
She just takes me as I am

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

When I turn away
She knows those are the times
There's nothing she can say
Nothing that anyone can do
And so she lets me live it through
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty
She just simply lets me be
And goes right on loving me

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more, oh

And when it seems my dreams
Have all slipped through my fingers
When they just can't be found
I turn around and there they are
Shining in her eyes (Shining in her eyes)

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me

From my heart will always be true
Now and forever
Together and all that I feel

Learning each day
That the right time was so far away
To tell you the things I knew
Now it's clear
That the moment
We searched for is here
And counting the years
Is all I want to do

Now and forever
Remember the words
From my heart will always be true
Now and forever
Together and all that I feel
Here's my love for you

Hold me as close
As love will allow
Until all your fears are gone
What has all passed
Is over now
I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm holding on
I'm holding on

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

When you're lost, where do you begin?
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look, then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched, I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight

Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back, how did I exist?
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight

Tonight I fell in love with you
And all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow
Baby, love is here and now there's

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people, two less lonely people
Two less lonely people in the world tonight

Two less lonely people in the world

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought, ""Well, isn't this nice?""
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A ""No Smoking"" sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife, hmph
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

And yeah, oh, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out

977,Céline Dion,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember when, no way, no how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allowed 
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allowed
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me...

And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him (Ooh)
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it)
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see

Ooh

If I let him walk away

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Words only you would hear
If only you were mine

Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time 

So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before 

Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

We'd be back to set things straight

I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me

When love is truly right

It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes 
And on the way it grows
But it never disappears

We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all

Always just beyond my touch
Though I needed you so much
After all what else is living for

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through

I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darlin' I never showed you (no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (but I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(I know you're looking down from heaven)
And I know eventually we'll be together (together we will)
One sweet day

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say"

And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow

And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only

And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only

And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be

Immortality

Is there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts, the joker's wild

But we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

'Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only

I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me, yeah

Immortality (Oh, baby)
There is a vision and a fire in me (Oho)

We don't say goodbye"
992,Jim Brickman;Martina McBride,Valentine,"If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
No way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart
Until the end of time
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
All of my life
I have been waiting for
All you give to me
You've opened my eyes
And shown me how to love unselfishly
I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
But in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
Until the end of time
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine

Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on
Like a fairy tale come true
Sitting by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed
I would find someone
And baby I found you

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more every day
You saved my heart
From being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful every day
For the gift

Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment


If only time stood still
But the colors fade away
And the years will make us grey
But baby in my eyes
You'll still be beautiful

(Piano solo)

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more every day
You saved my heart
From being broken apart
You gave your love away
I can't find the words to say
That I'm thankful everyday
For the gift"

And I pour the wine
It's four o'clock in the morning
And it's starting to get light

But I wish that it was still last night

You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side
When I go away I'll miss you
And I will be thinking of you
Every night and day just...

Promise me you'll wait for me
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way too

Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

Well I can't forget this evening
Nor your face as you were leaving

You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

997,Mariah Carey,I Still Believe,"You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart

And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I have a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type

If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream (I miss your love)
Someday you and me (Mmm, mmm)
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again..."
998,Mariah Carey,My All,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right

'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind

And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel

Give my all for your love tonight"
999,Mariah Carey,Open Arms,"Lying beside you
Here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say

So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms...

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say

So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms..."
1000,Mariah Carey,Hero,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Oh oh

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you"
1001,Debbie Gibson,Foolish Beat,"There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover

But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you

I could never love again the way that I loved you
Oh, I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

Oh, when I was sorry
It was too late to turn around (turn around)
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart

I could never love again the way that I loved you
Oh, I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart)
I could never love again now that we're apart"
1002,Debbie Gibson,Lost In Your Eyes,"I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can let go

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation is worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
Oh it's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes"
1003,Debbie Gibson,No More Rhyme,"When the fear sets in
Where the fire burns
Where I find a place
Where there's nowhere to turn
When the evening sings
An eerie song
Longing for the day
You say I'm wrong

You can find your place
But never fit in
And only when you've left
Do you know where you've been
I can see the light
But only when it's gone
You can go on waiting
But only for so long (so long, so long)

I know we are right
It's not always clear
Because I've never felt the fear
Can it stay so good
Forever in time?
I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when
There's no more rhyme?

Can we face ourselves
Like we face each other?
We've never felt anything
On our own
I can't wait much longer
To feel any danger
I hope we're not living for
A lifetime alone

I know we are right
It's not always clear
Because I've never felt the fear
Can it stay so good
Forever in time?
I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when
There's no more rhyme?

Hard to go on
It's like waiting for
The other shoe to drop
I'll never stop
Believing in you
It's just we never had to struggle
It all came too easy
I hope we felt what we felt from the start
We've never suffered a broken heart
We've been so blinded by all the best
We never put our love to the test (to the test)

I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when
There's no more rhyme?"
1004,Sheena Easton,Almost Over You,"I saw an old friend of ours today
She asked about you, I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you've been making the rounds 'round here
While I've been trying to make tears disappear

Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around 
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
Maybe leaving came easy, but it tore me apart
Time heals all wounds, they say, and I should know
'Cause it seems like forever, but I'm letting you go

Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around 
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

I can forgive you and soon I'll forget all my shattered dreams
Although you left me with nothing to show, full of misery

Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around 
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

When you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you"
1005,Taylor Dayne,Love Will Lead You Back,"Saying goodbye
Is never an easy thing
But you never said that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time that we'll be together

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
Darling I know, I know this will be

Sometimes it takes some time out on your own now
To find your way back home

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again

But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)

1008,Roxette,Listen To Your Heart,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns to dark

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been)
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before...

Oh, listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you

Don't ever go away

I fall into an ocean of you
Pull me out in time
Don't let me drown
Let me down
I say it's all because of you
And here I go
Losing my control
I'm practicing your name
So I can say it
To your face it doesn't
Seem right
To look you in the eye
Let all the things
You mean to me
Come tumbling out my mouth
Indeed it's time
Tell you why
I say it's
Infinitely true

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go
Like you do
Sway my way
Yeah I need to know
All about you

And there's no cure
And no way to be sure
Why everything's turned inside out
Instilling so much doubt
It makes me so tired
I feel so uninspired
My head is battling with my heart
My logic has been torn apart
And now
It all turns sour
Come sweeten
Every afternoon

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go

Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps

I want you to burn, baby
Oh

Laugh for me, cry for me
Reach for me, lie for me
Live for me, die for me

I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my life
Oh burn, burn for me, baby
Burn for me

I want you to burn
I want you to burn... for me baby!"
1011,Tina Arena,If I Didn't Love You,"So good
When it's good I wanna spend my whole life lovin' you
But I'm tired
And you don't know how close I've come to leaving you
You try my patience
And you race me to the wire
It takes every ounce of my will and desire

If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you like crazy
If I didn't love you baby
As much as I do
I'd just walk out the door
I couldn't take it anymore
I wouldn't put up with what you put me through
If I didn't love you

It's hard
But you won't give up till you
Push me to the wall
But I know
You're the only one who'll be there for me
When I call (oh yes you will)
I can't help believing
That it's worth it somehow
'Cause I've worked too damn hard
To wanna give up now

If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you like crazy
If I didn't love you baby
As much as I do
I'd just walk out the door
I couldn't take it anymore
I wouldn't put up with what you put me through
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
Nah, If I didn't
If I didn't love you like I do

When you love someone
Nothings black or white
When the riptide runs
There's no wrong or right
I'll sail with you but I'll refuse to drown
So don't you take me down, down
Take me down down
Don't you take me down, down, down
If I didn't love you

If I didn't love you
I'd walk out that door
I don't need it anymore
Need to put up with what you put me through
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you like I do o o o
I'd walk out that door
I'm not comin' back no more
No more"
1012,Styx,Babe,"Babe, I'm leaving, I must be on my way
The time is drawing near
My train is going, I see it in your eyes
The love, the need, your tears

But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

You know it's you, babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

You know it's you, babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

Babe, I'm leaving, I'll say it once again
Somehow try to smile
I know the feeling we're trying to forget
If only for a while

'Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
Please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you
Babe, I love you

Ooh, babe"
1013,REO Speedwagon,Can't Fight This Feeling,"I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I say there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
Ooh, ooh, ooh"
1014,Bee Gees,How Deep Is Your Love,"Ah

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

1015,Cliff Richard,Ocean Deep,"Love, can't you see I'm alone 
Can't you give this fool a chance 
A little love is all I ask 
A little kindness in the night 
Please don't leave me behind 
No, don't tell me love is blind 
A little love is all I ask 
And that is all 
Ooh love, I've been searchin' so long 
I've been searchin' high and low 
And little love is all I ask 
A little sadness when you go 
Maybe you'll need a friend 
Only please don't let's pretend 
A little love is all I ask 
And that is all 

I wanna spread my wings 
But I just can't fly 
As a string of pearls 
The pretty girls go sailin' by 

Ocean deep 
I'm so afraid to show my feelings 
I have sailed a million ceilings 
Solitary room 

Ocean deep 
Will I ever find a lover 
Maybe she has found another 
And as I cry myself to sleep 
I know this love of mine I'll keep 
Ocean deep 

Now, can't you hear when I call 
Can't you hear the word I say 
A little love is all I ask 
A little feelin' when we touch 

Why am I still alone 
I've got a heart without a home 
A little love is all I ask 
And that is all 

I wanna spread my wings 
But I just can't fly 
As a string of pearls 
The pretty girls go sailin' by 

Ocean deep 
I'm so afraid to show my feelings 
I have sailed a million ceilings 
Solitary room 

I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely (Ocean deep) 
On my own in my room 
I'm so lonely 
(Ocean deep) 
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely ..."
1016,Barry Manilow,Mandy,"I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you"
1017,George Benson,Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You,"If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever, oh, so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more then your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you
If you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you

1018,Stevie Wonder,Overjoyed,"Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do, they do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe, you too might be
Overjoyed, over-loved over me

Over heart, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do, they do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe you too might be
Overjoyed, over-loved over me

And though the odds say improbable, what do they know
For in romance all true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find you too like I
Overjoyed, over-loved over you
Over you"
1019,Stevie Wonder,I Just Called To Say I Love You - Single Version,"No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, it's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though oh, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
I just called (just called) to say (to say) how much I care, I do
I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, baby of my heart"
1020,Brian McKnight,Back At One,"It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The places you need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real

If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeaheah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one, yeaheaheah

So incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far

'Cause you know that you got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just till the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one"
1021,Brian McKnight,One Last Cry,"My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands
Standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
I gave my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to my last cry

I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie

I know I gotta be strong
Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I end my one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last time
Been living a lie
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down...
To my last cry"
1022,CoCo Lee,Before I Fall in Love,"My heart says we've got something real
Can I trust the way I feel
'Cause my heart's been through it before
Am I'm just seeing what I want to see
Or is it true, could you really be

Someone to have and hold
With all my heart and soul
I need to know
Before I fall in love

Someone who'll stay around
(Who warns)
My ups and downs
So tell me now
Before I fall in love

And I'm at the point of no return
So afraid of getting burned
But I wanna take a chance
Oh please, give me a reason to believe
Say you're the one that you'll always be

Someone to have and hold
With all my heart and soul
I need to know
Before I fall in love

Someone who'll stay around
(Who warns)
My ups and downs
So tell me now
Before I fall in love

It's been so hard for me
To give my heart away
But I would give my everything
Just to hear you say

Someone to have and hold
With all my heart and soul
I need to know
Before I fall in love

Someone who'll stay around
(Who warns)
My ups and downs
So tell me now
Before I fall in love"
1023,George Michael,Careless Whisper,"Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm

There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy, you bring when you call my name

You warmed my heart that once was cold

Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey hey
There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy, you bring when you call my name
Come on in out of the rain

Some people spend a lifetime looking for love
And I had love right here all of the time
Why did I try to deny it?
Deep inside I just couldn't fight it, you turned my life around
The love I lost is found, so let the rain come down

You told me that you'll love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain

I hailed a taxi in the rain
Looking for some place to ease the pain
Then like an answered prayer
I turned around and found you there
You really where start (you really know where to start)
Fixing a broken heart
You really know what to do
Your emotional tools
Can cure any fool
Whose dreams have fallen apart?
Fixing a broken heart
I never could understand
What you're going to through
There must be a plan that led me to you

Now I know I should make a move
What more can I say?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yes, I know of the harm I do

I know the choice to leave is mine

I'll follow through, I'll say I do

I'll make that move, and when I do
Will I doubt again, the way I do?

1030,Luther Vandross,I'd Rather,"I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)
And I tried and found
Out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got along just fine
But wasted time because she was not you
We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection built on lies, all lies
So I'm here 'cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart, who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you,
I can only prove the things I say with time,
Please be mine, oh ho please be mine

I'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you,
Than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime),
Than safe and warm by myself (surely surely baby)

We knew love could last forever
We're more than just lovers
We're good friends

And even if our love has drift away
I wouldn't even think twice
If I wanted love back again

Because I'd still say yes to you again
My darlin' for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I'd do it over and over again

Where does it go, how does it end
True love it seems so easy
'Cause we have no doubts
Where we belong (where we belong)

They say time can heal a broken heart
True love never ends
So why not start where we begin

Because I'd still say yes (say yes) to you again
My darlin' for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I'd do it over and over again

Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all

If I ain't got you with me, baby
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby"

1037,Sixpence None The Richer,Don't Dream It's Over,"There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never reach the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in"
1038,Barbra Streisand,Woman In Love,"Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time

We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts

We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say

No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
'Cause I know how you feel
What a woman can do

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything

To get you into my world
And hold you within

1039,Barbra Streisand;Céline Dion,Tell Him,"I'm scared
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
Ooh
What if
There's another one he's thinking of
Maybe he's in love
I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do

I've been there
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him (Ooh)
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it)
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see

Ooh
I love him (Then show him)
Of that much I can be sure (Hold him close to you)
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Ooh
Never let him go"
1040,Bread,Aubrey,"And Aubrey was her name
A not so very ordinary girl or name
But who's to blame?
For a love that wouldn't bloom
For the hearts that never played in tune
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing
Take away the words that rhyme, it doesn't mean a thing

And Aubrey was her name
We tripped the light and danced together to the moon
But where was June?
No, it never came around
If it did it never made a sound
Maybe I was absent or was listening too fast
Catching all the words but then the meaning going past

But God I miss the girl
And I'd go a thousand times around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me

And Aubrey was her name
I never knew her but I loved her just the same
I loved her name
Wish that I had found the way
And the reasons that would make her stay
I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest
If I can't have the one I want, I'll do without the best

But how I miss the girl
And I'd go a million times around the world just to say
She had been mine for a day"
1041,Dianne Reeves,Better Days,"Better days

Silver gray hair neatly combed in place.
There were four generations of love on her face.
She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes,
She'd seen it all.

I was a child, oh, about three or four.
All day I'd ask questions.
At night I'd ask more.
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong?
And why does what I want always take so long?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me?

I'd say, Grandma what is love?
Will I ever find out?
Why are we so poor, what is life about?
I wanna know the answers before I fall off to sleep.

She sort of smiled as she tucked me in.
Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again.
But tonight she was slightly, remarkably
Different somehow

Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep.
Grandma yawned as she stretched.
Then she started to speak.
What she told me, would mold me, and hold me
Together inside.

She said all the things you ask
You will know someday.
But you have got to live in a patient way.
God put us here by fate
And by fate that means better days.

She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night.
Ain't no morning gonna come till the time is right.
Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night.
You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.

You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night.
Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
(Be patient) oh baby, be patient.

Later that year, at the turn of spring,
Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings.
Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding
In better days

And although I'm all grown up
I still get confused.
I stumble through the dark
Getting bumped and bruised.
When night gets in my way
I could still hear my Grandma say
I can hear her say,
I can hear her say.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night baby.
(Be patient) Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
Child, do you hear me, yeah.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it, you got to make it
You got to make it
You got to make it through the night

(Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma
Do you see me now, lady
Oh oh oh oh oh...

(Be patient) She used to sit me on her knee
She used to comb my hair
She used to tell me stories...
My Grandma took me everywhere"

In the war of '44

When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light,
And say a little prayer for right
You know that if we are to stay alive
And see the peace in every eye

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over

Is the hardest thing to do
When you love someone as much as I love you

Oh I don't wanna leave you
Baby it tears me up inside
But I'll never be the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

Baby, it's never gonna work out
I love you, goodbye"
1052,Joe,No One Else Comes Close,"When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us
Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl, to me
And you'll always be, eternally
Everytime I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch, you can do so much

No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true
Oh, girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss, every day
I love you girl in every way
And I always will cause in my eyes

No one else comes close
No one else comes close

Damn I love you"
1053,Deborah Cox,Nobody's Supposed to Be Here,"How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
That heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken
Oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

This time I swear I'm through
But if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I've cried
This lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things

So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here (How did you)
Standing here (How did you get here?)
No, yeah (Nobody's supposed to be here)
Oouuuh

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
(No, oh, oh) How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here (Yeah, oh yeah)
I've tried that love thing for the last time (I've tried it over and over, you know)
My heart says no, no (My heart says no, no, no, no)
Nobody's supposed to be here (Nobody's supposed to be here)
But you came along and changed my mind (Came along and you changed)
How did you get here? (I'm not supposed to love you)
Nobody's supposed to be here (I'm not supposed to care anymore)
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Nobody's supposed to be here (No, no, no, no, no, no)
But you came along and changed my mind"
1054,Tamia,Officially Missing You,"All I hear is raindrops falling on the rooftop
Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go
'Cause this pain I feel it won't go away
And today I'm officially missin' you

I thought that from this heartache, I could escape
But I've fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today, I'm officially missing you

Ooh... can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do, hey, baby
Said it stays on my mind
And I'm officially

All I do is lay around, two years full of tears
From looking at your face on the wall
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I don't even know you at all,
I don't know you at all

Well, I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess it's safe to say, baby
Safe to say that I'm officially missin' you

Ooh... can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do, hey, baby
Said it stays on my mind
And I'm officially

Well, I thought I could just get over you, baby
But I see there's something I just can't do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just can't find a way to let go of you

Ooh... can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do, hey, baby
Said it stays on my mind
And I'm officially

It's official
Hoo... you know that I'm missin' you, yeah, yes
All I hear is raindrops, ooh, yeah
And I'm officially missin' you"
1055,Vanessa Carlton,A Thousand Miles,"Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these 
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me 
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you, oh, oh

If I could just hold you tonight"
1056,Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories,Stay,"You say
I only hear what I want to
You say
I talk so all the time
So

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leavin'
Now I know that I did somethin' wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah I missed you

And you say
I only hear what I want to, I don't listen hard
Don't pay attention to the distance that you're runnin'
To anyone, anywhere, I
Don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative 
No, no, no (bad)

So I, I turn the radio on, I turn the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song
Lovers in love and the others run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover while we're waiting for the other who was dyin' since the day they were born, well
Well, this is not that, think that I'm throwin' but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
That won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere 
With you

You said that I was naive, and (naive...)
I thought that I was strong, oh
I thought, ""hey, I can leave, I can leave"", oh (leave...)
But now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you
Yeah... I miss you

You said, ""You caught me 'cause you want me"" and one day you let me go
You try to keep away a keeper or keep me 'cause you know you're just so 
Scared to lose

And you say
""Stay""

You say
I only hear what I want to"
1057,Fra Lippo Lippi,Stitches And Burns,"People say that I'm a fool
Well I don't know
At least I found out
What it takes to be strong
I was dreaming all day long
A drifting cloud
With eyes wide open
I would choose not to see

*Now I don't want
To see you anymore
Don't want to be the one
To play your game
Not even if you smile
Your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me
Darling please

Say good morning to the world
I hope you like it


Take good care of all those
Things that we have
I've been looking for a way
For to long now
Seems like everything
Must come to an end

*Repeat

Time after time
Nothing that I can do
Knowing your ways
And loving your ways
But not getting through at all
Day after day
Leaving the past behind
Coming to terms
With stitches and burns and
Learning to fly again"
1058,Fra Lippo Lippi;Per Sorensen,Later,"""Later""

How could you come with me
When you knew all along that you had to go
How could you watch me sleep so close to you
Pretending not to know
How could you memorize my name
And forget who I am
How could you think you're still the same
Believing I can

It's too late to start pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later than the sunset, later than the rain
Later than I never to love you again

How could you ask for more with an innocent smile
Trusting me to stay
How could you close the door and leave me here
Supposing I'm ok
How could you breakdown my disguise
And uncover my fears
How could you look into my eyes
Ignoring my tears"

We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only let me try
You touch me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready
To kiss that dream goodbye

When it's this sweet, there's no saying no
I need you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire

But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you

I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you

So cry no more

Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes, ami

'Neath the waves 
Through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told 
It can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin

Throw it to the wind, my love
Hold me dear
All's forgotten now, my love
We're all alone"

Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him, and listen for a while.
And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time)
Singing my life with his words (two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

I felt he found my letters, and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on

And life was nothing but an distrustful song

I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away

Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face

Yeah, it's telling me it might be you

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some time
Maybe all we need is time...

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more

Is walkin' around with me

I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes

Is that you just don't realise

What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much 
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again"
1076,Bread,If,"If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show 
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away"
1077,Bread,Diary,"I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words she'd written took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes
They said that she had found
The love she'd waited for
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it

When she confronted with the writing there
Simply pretended not to care
I passed it off as just in keeping with
Her total disconcerting air
And though she tried to hide
The love that she denied
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will give to her my wife
All the sweet things I can find

I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words began to stick and tears to flow
Her meaning now was clear to see
The love she'd waited for
Was someone else not me
Wouldn't you know it
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will wish for her his wife
All the sweet things she can find
All the sweet things they can find"
1078,Michael Johnson,I'll Always Love You,"Standing by my window, listening for your call
Guess I really miss you after all
Time won't let me keep these sad thoughts to myself
I'd just like to let you know, I wish I'd never let you go

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
The days and nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see how much your love has meant to me

And I'll always love you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Time like a river keeps on rollin' right on by
Nothing left for me to do
So I watch the river rise

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will
I'll still, I will love you"
1079,Heart,What About Love?,"I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well
On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing and you got to
Look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only want to share it with you
What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only want to share it with you"

This world that I found
Is too good to be true

Want so much to give you

Let them say we're crazy
I don't care 'bout that

1081,Atlantic Starr,Secret Lovers,"Here we are the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out
It could mess up, both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
They can never no, oh no, we can't leave a trace

Secret lovers that's what we are, we shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go, oh no, 'cause we love each other so

Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously, alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall

Secret lovers that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go, 'cause what we feel is oh so real
So real

You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel, or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin' love we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful, so that no one will know

Secret lovers, that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is oh so real
So real"
1082,Toto,I'll Be Over You,"Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

(Instrumental solo)

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart...

1083,Bonnie Tyler,Straight from the Heart,"I could start dreaming but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreaming
And that's straight from the heart
You said it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Coming straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we could make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

I'll see you on the street some other time
But all our words will just fall out of line
While we're dreaming
Straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we could make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we could make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as lknow
It's coming straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we could make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart"

All the tears I cried
All the pain I kept inside
I kept asking myself why
You had to say goodbye

Was it just a dream
When you said to me
That there was someone new in your life
You could have at least lied
The truth just scared me

Even if
You mean the whole damn world to me
I can forget you
Wait and see
I can be strong even without you
I can't waste my life forever hoping you'd
Come back to me
But deep inside I know
I'll be waiting here for you"

A certain kind of light
That never shone on me

To lived with you, to lived with you
There's a way
Everybody say's
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, I ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, if I ain't got you, baby

You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like

1089,TLC,Waterfalls,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much

But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little Precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me.""

One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Ya'll don't hear me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come On
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries

My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps em' in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine into your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane
And name this day and time
For fallin' prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast"
1090,Christina Aguilera,Beautiful,"Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone, left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no, no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeaheah, yeaheah!)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine!)
And tomorrow we might awake on the other side

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh no, ooh
Yeaheah
Don't you bring me down today, heyey
Don't you bring me down today"

But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you do to me
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time after time I try to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In your condition I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, oh

I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain

I get so weak
Something 'bout the way ya do the things you do it
Knocks me right off of my feet, oh
I can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me

1093,Kelly Clarkson,Breakaway,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Breakaway

And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for awhile
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile

I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay a home and watch TV
You see it really doesn't matter much to me

And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I won't ask for promises

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye

All the world is a stage (world is a stage)
And everyone has their part (has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
(You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye
Say goodbye"
1102,Eagles,Love Will Keep Us Alive,"I was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry
Love will keep us alive

Don't you worry
Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride
The world is changing
Right before your eyes
Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry
Love will keep us alive

I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do

Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry
Love will keep us alive

I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do

I was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry
Love will keep us alive
When we're hungry
Love will keep us alive
When we're hungry
Love will keep us alive"

1104,Harem Scarem,Honestly,"I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong

Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind

All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with, living with a lonely feeling"
1105,Phil Collins,Against All Odds,"How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now

It's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me now"

And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

But I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you"
1110,Billy Joel,Honesty,"If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live

But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve

But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover, I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know, I know

When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone

But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
'Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you"
1111,Dusty Springfield,You Don't Have To Say You Love Me,"When I said, I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away

Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
And that I have to follow you
And beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me, I'll never tie you down

Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
Believe me"

And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way

But I miss you more than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Left me just when I needed you most

Now most every morning, I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me

'Cause I need you more than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Left me just when I needed you most

Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We'll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years, as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with you"

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me
Love of my life can't you see
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over, and everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you - I still love you

Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life

I see the distant lights that left behind the day
But what I see is so much more than I can say
And I see you in midnight blue

I see you cryin' now, you've found a lot of pain
And what you're searchin' for can never be the same
But what's the difference 'cause they say what's in a name?
And I see you in midnight blue

I will love you tonight
And I will stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue

I see you standing there far out along the way
I want to touch you, but the night becomes the day
I count the words that I am never gonna say
And I see you in midnight blue

I will love you tonight
And I will stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue

Can't you feel the love that I'm offering you?
Can't you see how it's meant to be?
Can't you hear the words that I'm saying to you?
Can't you believe like I believe?
It's only one and one it's true
Still I see you in midnight blue

I see beautiful days
And I feel beautiful ways
Of loving you, everything's midnight blue

I will love you tonight
And I will stay by your side

Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

All my life, now and forever till the
Day I die, you and I will share

All the things this changing world can offer
So I sing, I'd be happy just to
Stay this way, spend each day, with you

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line

It would have passed away
It would have passed away
It would have passed away

All my life, I will carry you through
All my life, between each hour of the passing days
I will stay with you

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent

Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years
Through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad
To be with you
Through the years
It's better every day
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years
When everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belonged
Right here with you
Through the years
I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out
I've learned what life's about
By loving you
Through the years

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
It's better every day
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you

1123,Patty Smyth;Don Henley,Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,"Now, I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes love, it just ain't enough"

1125,Dan Hill,Sometimes When We Touch,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides"
1126,Christina Aguilera,Reflection,"Look at me
You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day

It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in

But somehow
I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know?

Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be
Free to fly
That burns with a need to know
The reason why

Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm

Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?"

You are the reason I survived

I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I love you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need

You are too beautiful for the human eye

You are the dream that never dies
You are the fire that burns inside
Baby

I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I love you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need
Someone as much as I need you

You are the sunshine in the sky
You are the sparkle in my eyes

1131,Bette Midler,From A Distance,"From a distance, the world looks blue and green,
And the snow capped mountains white.
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream,
And the eagle takes to flight.

From a distance, there is harmony,
And it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man.

From a distance, we don't have enough,
And no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
No hungry mouse to feed.

From a distance, we are instruments
Marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope, 
Playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.

God is watching us. 
God is watching us.
God is watching us 
From a distance.

From a distance, you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for.

From a distance, there is harmony,
And it echoes through the land.
And it's the hope of hopes, 
It's the love of loves,
It's the heart of every man.
It's the hope of hopes, 
It's the love of loves.
This is the song of every man.

And God is watching us, 
God is watching us,
God is watching us 
From a distance.
Oh, God is watching us, 
God is watching.
God is watching us 
From a distance."

You're the one I think about each day (the one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

Jo:
You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will, you know you will, oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
There's no use looking back or wondering (or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing (and funny thing)
No matter how I try and try I just can't say good-bye
No, no, no, no

All:
I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though, I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (the one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

Jo:
A part of me will always be with you

1134,Rick Price,Heaven Knows,"She's always on my mind,
From the time I wake up
Till I close my eyes
She's everywhere I go
She's all I know

'Though she's so far away
It's just keeps getting stronger
Every day
And even now she's gone
I'm still holding on

So tell me where do I start
'Cause it's breaking my heart
Don't wanna let her go

Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find their way
Only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows

My friends keep telling me
That if you really love her
You've gotta set her free
And if she returns in kind
I'll know she's mine

So tell me where do I start
'Cause it's breaking my heart
Don't wanna let her go

Why I live in despair
'Cause while awake or dreaming
I know she's never there
And all these time I act so brave
I'm shaking inside
Why does it hurt me so...

Heaven knows..."
1135,Boyz II Men,On Bended Knee,"And I...

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl.
I know you put all your trust
In me, I'm sorry I let you down.
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason

I'll never walk again, until you come back to me

1136,LeAnn Rimes,Insensitive,"How do you cool your lips, after a summer's kiss?
How do you rid the sweat, after the body bliss?
How do you turn your eyes, from the romantic glare?
How do you block the sound of a voice
You'd know anywhere?

Oh, I really should've known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual goodbyes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face that told me
Maybe you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

Insensitive

How do you numb your skin, after the warmest touch?
How do you slow your blood, after the body rush?
How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend?
How do you teach your heart it's time to fall in love again?

Oh, you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch
I fell too fast, I feel too much
I thought that you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

Oh, I really should've known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual goodbyes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face that told me
Maybe you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

1137,Eric Gadd,Do You Believe In Me,"She was workin' everyday down the street
Selling flowers
Pretending she was blind
So I said, ""Won't you please believe me
Instead of running 'round and
Laughing all the time?""
She was five foot four and lonely
As she walked into my room,
""So this is where you stay""
But when I tried to tell her
About these lonely walls
There was nothing, I could say

Do you believe in me
I'm yours you're mine
And though you refuse to see, I'll be behind

Anyday & anyway another rain had to come
And it got to me as well, well, well
When your losing what you came for
In the first place it gets fogged
Believe me, I can tell, I can tell
So I slip into my lonely room
And saying to myself
It doesn't matter if I fall
But then I heard some noises at my door and far away
There was somebody, somebody who shouted

Do you believe in me
I'm yours, you're mine
And though you refuse to see
I'll be behind

Do you believe in me
I'm yours, you're mine
And though you refuse to see
I'll be behind
Do you want to ? (do you want today)
I'll be hearing you someday say
Do you want my love
Do you want my love

She was workin' everyday down the street
Selling flowers, pretending she was blind
So I said won't you please believe me
Instead of running 'round and
Laughing all the time (Somebody who shouted)
Do you believe in me
I'm yours you're mine
And though you refuse to see
I'll be behind

Do you believe in me
I'm yours you're mine
And though you refuse to see
I'll be behind

Do you believe in me
I'm yours you're mine
And though you refuse to see
I'll be behind"

1139,Céline Dion,The Power of Love,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love"
1140,Barry Manilow,Somewhere Down the Road,"We had the right love
At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time

Those dreams of yours
Are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away 
I have no right to make you stay

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me

Sometimes goodbyes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home

And somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me

Letting go is just another way to say 
I'll always love you so

We had the right love
At the wrong time
Maybe we've only just begun 
Maybe the best is yet to come

Cause somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me"
1141,Michael Bolton,How Am I Supposed to Live Without You,"I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

What if I never knew
What if I never found you
I never had
This feeling in my heart

How did this come to be
I don't know how you found me
But from the moment I saw you
Deep inside my heart I knew

Baby you're my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
Ill give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
You were always meant to be
My destiny

Ooh
I wanted someone like you
Someone that I could hold on to
And give my love until the end
Of time

Ooh
But forever was just a word (just a word)
Something id only heard about
But now you're always there for me
When you say forever I believe

Baby you're my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
Ill give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
You were always meant to be
My destiny

Ooh

Maybe all we need
Is just a little faith
'Cause baby I believe
That love will find a way

Hey

Oh

Baby you're my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
Ill give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
From now until eternity
You were always meant to be

My destiny

1143,Julia Fordham,(Love Moves In) Mysterious Ways,"(Written by Tom Snow and Dean Pitchford)

Who'd have thought this is how the pieces fit
You and I shouldn't even try making sense of it
I forgot how we ever came this far
I believe we had reasons but I don't know what they are
Don't blame it on my heart, oh

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Heaven knows love is just a chance we take
We make plans but then love demands a leap of faith
So hold me close and never never let me go
'Cause even though we think we know which way the river flows
That's not the way love goes, no

Like the ticking of a clock two hearts beat as one
But I'll never understand the way it's done, oh

Love moves... in mysterious ways..."
1144,Brenda Russell,Piano In The Dark,"When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
It's pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart (thief of the heart)
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
It's pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
In the dark...

The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
Oh baby, pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
I cry, I cry

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little

Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

In the dark

I can't let go..."
1145,Berlin,Take My Breath Away,"Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

Take my breath away
My love
Take my breath away
Oh yeah
Take my breath away (yeah)
My love
Take my breath away"

When I opened my eyes and there you were,
You were more than a dream,
I could reach out and touch you,
Girl that was long ago.
There are somethings that I guess I'll never know,
When you love someone You got to learn to let them go.

When I dream about you,
That's when everything's all right,
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever.
When I dream about you,
Girl you never go away,
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams,
'Cause I still love, loving you.

How can I get you to see
That I'm falling apart
Since you've been gone,
I can never be sure
I could ever let go
Your love is much to strong,
There are somethings that I guess
I'll never know,

When you love someone
You got to learn to let them go.

When I dream about you,
That's when everything's all right,
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever.
When I dream about you,

Wait for my dreams,

The only way to fly is on the wings of love
On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, flying high upon the wings of love

You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
And I'm crazy 'bout ya, baby, can't you see
I'd be so delighted if you would come with me

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love
On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, flying high upon the wings of love

Yes, you belong to me and I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live and breathe each other
Inseparable it seems, we're flowing like a stream
Running free travelling on the wings of love

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love

All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word
And tell me that I'm forgiven

You and me
We're gonna be
Better than we were before
I loved you then but now I intend
To open up and love you even more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go

I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

Looking back now
It seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted

But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love
That still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see
It's gonna be
Sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to given more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever

I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in
Said you can't win

But one day the sun came a-shining through
The rain had stopped, and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying ""I love you"" to me

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
A one in a million you

I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill
Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth living again
For to love you to me is to live

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
A one in a million you

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called you
One in a million you

A one in a million you"

And made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one
Since you took me in
I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow
Reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow
If you should go away

I'll stand here and remember
Just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on"

You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you care when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you and with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

My love
Whenever I was insecure
You build me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you I always had a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new"

'Neath the waves
Through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do
Lovers too, so cast
Your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, oh, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Owe it to the wind, my love
Hold me dear

All's forgotten now, my love
We're all alone"

Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries"

1162,Rex Smith,Forever,"They say that you and I
Are reachin' far too high
We know our love is young
We've only just begun.

Through the night
We hold each other tight forever (forever, forever)

A love like yours and mine
Will stand the test o' time
Like rivers to the sea
Your love returns to me

Through the night
We hold each other tight forever (forever, forever)

Forever
I'll be yours forever
You're mine

You will be the one to fill my life
To stand beside me
I will be the one
The one you'll run to
You can depend on

Forever
I'll be yours forever
You're mine

Forever
I'll be yours forever
You're mine

Forever, forever
Forever, forever
Forever"
1163,Stevie B,Waiting For Your Love,"How can I explain the sorrow and my pain
I believe that you and I should be together once again
Every night I pray, that you'll come back to me
But the tears keep falling down my face, when you're not around
And I know you're gone... gone away
All I do is wait for you each and every day
And I know you're gone, gone away
All I do is wait for you each and every day
Ooh I'm waiting for your love
I'm Wondering where you are, are you with another guy
Are you showing him your world
I'm waiting for your love, I wanna see your smile,
Brighten up my day
Yes I'm waiting for your love
Yes I'm waiting for your love
Many sleepless night
I waited by the phone, wondering where you are tonight
If you are alone, if I had another chance (another chance)
I'd never let you go
My heart's been broken in two... and it's all because of you
And I know you're gone... gone away
All I do is wait for you, each and every day
And I know you're gone, gone away
All I do is wait for you, each and everyday
Oh I'm waiting for your love
I'm wondering where you are, are you with another guy
Are you showing him your world
I've been waiting for your love
I wanna see your smile, brighten up my day
Yes, I'm waiting for your love
Yes, I'm waiting for you love
Oh I'm waiting for your love
I'm wondering where you are, are you with another guy
Are you showing him the world
I'm waiting for your love

1164,The Jets,You Got It All,"I, I was a game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all over him

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got

1165,Gloria Estefan;Miami Sound Machine,Anything for You,"Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years

Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye"

Since you've been gone

From crying all night long
Know I've never been too good at cooking just for one
It's so lonely here without you darling
Come back home

'Cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love

Know life hasn't been much fun at all
Since you've been gone
And my eyes begin to fill
Each time I hear our song
I spent every minute asking myself
What went wrong
Can't we try to talk it over baby
Come back home

'Cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love
But baby there is no one else
Half crazy
For everything you saying
Half crazy
No one else could love you like I do

And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me

I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

Watching shadows move across the wall
I feel so frightened
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning

Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone

1169,Seal,Kiss From A Rose,"There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea,
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know, that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny,
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I'm kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby, the stranger it feels, yeah
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
And if I should fall, would it all go away?
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny,

The love you bring to me
No matter where I go
And I know that you'll be there
For ever more a part of me you're everywhere

I'll be standing by your side in all you do
And I won't ever leave as long as you believe

1174,Barry Manilow,Weekend in New England,"Last night I waved goodbye, now it seems years
I'm back in the city where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you, bringing us near
And tell me
When will our eyes meet? 
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

Time in New England took me away
To long rocky beaches and you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait
And tell me
When will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

I feel the change coming, I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring, I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out all the love that I had
With you there's a heaven so earth ain't so bad
And tell me
When will our eyes meet? 
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?
Again"
1175,Tiffany,All This Time,"All this time
I knew someday you'd need to find
Something that you left behind
Something I can't give you

All these tears
And like alight love disappears
But hearts are good for souvenirs
And memories are forever

All this time
All in all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
The heart forgives the heart forgets
But what will I do now with all this time

One more kiss
Even though it's come to this
I'll close my eyes and make a wish
Hoping you remember

All this time
All in all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
The heart forgives the heart forgets
But what will I do now with all this time

Say goodbye
Apart we'll make another try
But don't be sorry if you cry
I'll be crying too
On this day

All this time
All in all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
The heart forgives the heart forgets
But what will I do now with all this time
What will I do now with all this time"

Everything I want in life is right here

I was not prepared enough 
To fall so deep in love 
This is not your ordinary

To fall so deep in love

I knew that I just couldn't let you go at all 
From this day on, remember this: 
That you're the only one that I adore 
Can't we make this last forever 
This can't be a dream
Cause it feels so good to me

With each passing day
You've come so far
Don't throw it away

Wonders are waiting to start
Live your story
Faith hope and glory
Hold to the truth in your heart

If we hold on together
I know our dreams will never die
Dreams see us through to forever
Where clouds roll by
For you and I

Souls in the winds
Must learn how to bend
Seek out a star
Hold on to the end
Valley, mountain
There is a fountain
Washes our tears all away
Words are swaying
Someone is praying
Please let us come home to stay

If we hold on together
I know our dreams will never die
Dreams see us through to forever
Where clouds roll by
For you and I

When we are out there in the dark
We'll dream about the sun
In the dark, we'll feel the light
Warm our hearts, everyone

If we hold on together
I know our dreams will never die
Dreams see us through to forever
As high as souls can fly
The clouds roll by
For you and I"
1183,Angela Bofill,Break It To Me Gently,"Did you think that your smile
Could hide what's on your mind?
No matter how I tried
I just couldn't be so blind
We've been close but people grow,
And they sometimes grow apart
There's just one thing I ask you
If you've had a change of heart...

(And) Break it to me gently,
If ya have to, then tell me lies
Break it to me gently,
At least leave me with my pride
Try to spare my feelings
If the feelings have to die
Break it to me gently,
If you have to say goodbye

I'm not ashamed to admit
I really hurt inside
After all these are my feelings,
Why should I make them hide?
But I won't hold you back,
There'll be no pulling on your sleeve
Just let me down easy,
And go softly when you leave...

(And) Break it to me gently,
If ya have to, then tell me lies
Break it to me gently,
At least leave me with my pride
Try to spare my feelings
If the feelings have to die
Break it to me gently,
If you have to say goodbye

You always knew that you had my heart
It's still yours, if you wanna take it
But when you go, as I know you must,
Be gentle with your breaking

(And) Break it to me gently,
If ya have to, then tell me lies
Break it to me gently,
At least leave me with my pride
Trust me and my feelings
If the feelings have to die
Break it to me gently,
If you have to say goodbye

Break it to me gently,
If you have to say goodbye,
Goodbye, goodbye..."

1185,Firehouse,I Live My Life for You,"You know you're everything to me
And I could never see, the two of us apart
And you know I give myself to you
And no matter what you do, I promise you my heart

I've built my world around you and I want you to know
I need you, like I've never needed anyone before

I live my life for you
I want to be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I live my life for you

I dedicated my life to you
You know that I would die for you
But our love would last forever
And I will always be with you
And there is nothing we can't do
As long as we're together

I just can't live without you, and I want you to know
I need you like I've never needed anyone before

I live my life for you
I want to be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true

I need you, like I've never needed anyone before

Wow, yeah I live my life for you"
1186,Jim Brickman;Michael W. Smith,Love of My Life,"I am amazed 
When I look at you
I see you smiling back at me
It's like all my dreams come true 

I am afraid 
If I lost you, girl
I'd fall through the cracks 
And lose my track in this crazy lonely world

Sometimes it's so hard to believe 
When the nights can be so long
And faith gave me the strength 
And kept me holding on

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me

I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life

Now here you are 
With midnight closing in
You take my hand as our shadows dance
With moonlight on your skin

I look in your eyes
I'm lost inside your kiss
I think if I'd never met you
About all the things I'd missed

Sometimes it's so hard to believe
When a love can be so strong 
And faith gave me the strength 
And kept me holding on

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me

I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me

I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love
My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life"
1187,Kenny Loggins,For the First Time,"Are those your eyes, is that your smile?
I've been looking at you forever, but I never saw you before
Are these your hands holding mine?
Now I wonder how I could have been so blind

For the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me...
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the First Time

Can this be real? Can this be true?
Am I the person I was this mornin' and are you the same you?
It's all so strange... how can it be?
All along this love was right in front of me

For the first time... I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I am seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the First time

Such a long time ago I had given up on finding this emotion ever again
But you're here with me now
Yes, I found you somehow
And I've never been so sure

And for the first time
I am looking in your eyes
For the first time, I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me

Now I understand what love is, love is
For The First Time..."

We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

Hear me crying out to you
You said, ""never, never would I leave""
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart, I'll pretend
That you are here again

Hear me crying out to you
You said, ""never, never would I leave""
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

Give me one more chance to
Make it real"
1192,James Ingram,I Don't Have The Heart,"Your face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand
I care about you
So much about you, baby
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh no
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way that you want me to

(I don't have the heart) Ooh
Baby, I don't have the heart, I don't have the heart

1195,Quincy Jones,Just Once,"Featuring James Ingram

I did my best
But I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothing ever changes
We're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay
Or head on out the door

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why we never last for very long
What are we doing wrong
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it
I know we could break through it

I gave my all
But I think my all may have been too much
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going
And seems at times with all we've got
We haven't got a prayer
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why the goodtimes never last for very long


Seems we're always blowing
Whatever we got going

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it
I know we could break through it

Just once I want to understand
Why it always come back to good-bye
Why can't we get ourselves in hand
And admit to one another
That we're no good without the other
Take the best and make it better
Find a way to stay together

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we can break through it
If we could just get to it

Just once
If we could get to it

Just Once..."
1196,The Jets,You Got It All,"I, I was a game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all over him

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb

To fall in love, that's what everyone's dreaming of
I hold this feeling oh so strong
Life is too short, to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love, will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

I close my eyes and pray all my wishes come true
Every night I go to sleep
Until you're mine I'll wait for you endlessly
Can't you see fairy tales they do, sometimes come true
If you believe it could happen to you
Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever (live forever)

Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for
Shower me with your love

1200,George Benson,In Your Eyes,"I think I finally know you
I can see beyond your smile
I think that I can show you
That what we have is still worthwhile

Don't you know that love's just like the thread
That keeps unravelling but then
It ties us back together in the end

In your eyes
I can see my dreams reflections
In your eyes
From the answers to my questions
In your eyes
I can see the reasons why our loves alive
In your eyes
We're drifting safely back to shore
I think I've finally learned to love you more

She warned me that life changes
And that no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow

Even though the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same
Through it all our love will still remain

In your eyes
I can see my dreams reflections
In your eyes
From the answers to my questions
In your eyes
I can see the reasons why our loves alive
In your eyes
We're drifting safely back to shore
And I think I've finally learned to love you more

In your eyes
I can see the reasons why our loves alive
You and i
We're drifting safely back to shore
I think I've finally learned to love you more"

Then I turned around to say that I loved you
Then I realized
That it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me...

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe (just can't believe)
That we're through...

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
All the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

I've got to gather my senses together (Gather)
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now (over now)
Be strong (be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.

I miss you (I miss you...)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me"

And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you, waiting for you"

I've never seen you shine so bright
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight
I never will forget
The way you look tonight

The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red

I love you"
1206,Elton John,Your Song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world"
1207,Steve Perry,Foolish Heart,"I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
That each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there, ready to share...

I need a love that's strong

But will my lonely heart play the part
Of the fool again
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Feeling that feeling again
I'm playing a game I can't win
Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let her in
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Foolish heart...
Foolish, foolish heart

You've been wrong before

(Foolish)
(Foolish)

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning

Don't be wrong anymore

Oh foolish, foolish heart

You've been wrong before

Foolish, foolish heart

That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining

For good times and bad times

Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see

1209,Toto,I'll Be Over You,"Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

(Instrumental solo)

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart...

1210,Whitney Houston,All at Once,"All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back;
And it finally hit me, all at once

All at once
I started counting teardrops, and at least a million fell;
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once

Ever since I met you, you're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you, though I must face it all alone

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea, wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea, holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know, so much more than it shows;
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once

All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day;
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

Ever since I met you, you're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you, though I must face it all alone

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea, wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea, holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know, so much more than it shows;
All at once

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea, wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know! So much more than it shows
All at once

And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea, wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know

I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home
Don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me)

Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be 
Bluer than blue

After you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you're gone I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be 
Bluer than blue

I don't have to miss no TV shows
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder

And I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be 
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Now looking back at all we've planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?"
1215,David Soul,Don't Give Up On Us,"Don't give up on us, baby
Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer 
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby"
1216,The Stylistics,You Are Everything,"Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
She walked like you do
I thought it was you
As she turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you?
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

'Cause you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

You are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything

Funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound

I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

I know this much is true
I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin (All night long)
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound

Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be known

I know this much is true
I know this much is true

I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

'Cause we're both lying here
There's so many things I wanna say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever 
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of
We'll live forever 
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love 

It's like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that your dreaming of
We're gonna live for ever

That we did it all for the glory of love

A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened

Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, ""You're so sincere""

We sailed on together 
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms 

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back 
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

Hmm, words cannot express how much you mean to me
There must be some other way to make you see
If it takes my heart and soul, you know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down

You know you got the power, girl, to keep me holding on
So now you got the best of me
Come on and take the rest of me
Oh baby

Hmm, though you're close to me, we seem so far apart
Maybe given time you'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever, girl, then I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me won't be a day too late

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing

No one's been able to show me how
To fill my life like you
You are the one who taught me to

And if you walked away from me today
Never to return until the journey
That you made had ended
I know you planned it

What it feels like to overflow
Until my life is through

Only for you

Across the sky
Out where the world belongs
To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life.

In a lifetime
There is only love
Reaching for the lonely one
We are stronger when we are given love
When we put emotions on the line
Know that we are the timeless ones

Meet me halfway
Across the sky

To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life."

How can I tell her about you?

How can I tell her about you?
Girl, please tell me what to do

How to tell her about you

How can I tell her I don't miss her
Whenever I am away
How can I say it's you I think of

As if somebody led my hand,
It seems I hardly had to steer,
My course was planned.
And destiny it guides us all,
And by it's hand we rise and fall,
But only for a moment,
Time enough to catch our breath again.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
How one live touches the other,
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together,
We travel through as far as we can,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.

Taking in the times gone by,
We wonder how it all began,
We'll never know and still we
Try to understand.
And even though the seasons change,
The reasons shall remain the same,
It's love that keeps us holding on
Till we can see the sun again.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.

And I stand alone, a man of stone,
Against the driving rain,
And the night it's got your number,
And the wind it cries your name,
If we search for truth, win or lose,
In this we're all the same,
The hope still burns eternal,
We're the keeper of the flame.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
How one live touches the other,
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together,
We try and go as far as we can,
And we have waited for this moment in time,

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel

I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes"

We were just too young to know
We fell in love and let it go 
So easy to say the words goodbye
So hard to let the feelings die
I know how much I need you now
The time is turning back somehow
As soon as our heart and souls unite 
I know for sure we'll get the feeling right

And now we're starting over again
It's not the easiest thing to do
I'm feeling inside again
'Cause every time I look at you
I know we're starting over again
This time we'll love all the pain
Welcome home, my lover and friend
We are starting over, over again

If we never lived alone
Then we might have never known
All the time we spent apart
All we did was break each other's heart

And when I hold you in my arms, I promise you
You're gonna feel a love that's beautiful and new
This time, I'll love you even better
Than I ever did before
And you'll be in my heart forever

And now we're starting over again
It's not the easiest thing to do
I'm feeling inside again
'Cause every time I look at you
I know we're starting over again
This time we'll love all the pain away
Welcome home, my lover and friend
We are starting over, over again

This time we'll chase all the rain away
Welcome home, my lover and friend

Aren't we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Aren't we too grown for changin'?
Aren't we too grown to mess around?
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

Ooh, ooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Trying to do what lovers do (ooh)
Ooh, ooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh

1247,Macklemore;Skylar Grey,Glorious (feat. Skylar Grey),"You know I'm back like I never left (I never left) 
Another sprint, another step (Another step) 
Another day, another breath (Another breath) 
Been chasin' dreams, but I never slept
I got a new attitude and a lease on life 
And some peace of mind
You seek and I find, I can sleep when I die 
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit, I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?

I heard you die twice
Once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time
That somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth
Did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people
Or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus
Searching for euphoria
Trudgin' through the mud to find the present, no ignorin' us
Got twenty thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors 
My mama told me, ""Never bow your head"" (Woo)

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now, I see the sunrise 
Now I feel glorious, glorious 
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh, yes it is)
You know that we been goin' in (Been goin' in)
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win) 
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone 
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smilin' down on me like, ""Woo, that boy got bars!"" 
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith, and I remember why I came, woo!

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night And now, I see the sunrise
And now, I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine 
We're planting our flag, they don't understand 
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

We gon' be alright, put that on my life

But these days I don't even know myself, no
I always thought I'd be with someone else
I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah

I call you but you never even answer
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
But then I get so numb with all the laughter
That I forget about the pain

Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
You drag me down, you fuck me up
We're on the ground, we're screaming
I don't know how to make it stop
I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
But I keep on coming back to you

I know my friends, they give me bad advice
Like move on, get you out my mind
But don't you think I haven't even tried?
You got me cornered and my hands are tied

You got me so addicted to the drama
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
But then I get so numb with all the laughter
That I forget about the pain

Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me

Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you

And I guess you'll never know
All the bullshit that you put me through
And I guess you'll never know, no
Yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder
You can be the pill to ease the pain
'Cause I know I'm addicted to your drama

A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?

The way you move it here (Hey)

Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came in through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world

Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone

What we're feelin' inside

While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you

Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

But then I see your face

Tryna make it disappear

In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be

Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?

Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass

You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as sample
And I can't help but stare, cause

I can't ever change without you

Would look at us all the time

The way it feels to be completely intertwined

And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun

And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)

And she left before I had the chance to say, ohh
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath, I'll never get over 
And the noises that she made kept me awake, ohh
The weight of the things that remain unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe it

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Ohh, it's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you, ohh

Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Ohh, it's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right

So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
Will keep you by my side, will keep you from walkin' out the door

Your daddy can't even look me in the eye

Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make you mine

It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

And the dampness of tears that left
That stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

3 more days 'til I see your face
I'm afraid it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up
If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night
And I know what your friends say:
He's just wasting your love and time
I will never let you change your mind

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause your all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack

It's killing me, swear I never cried so much,
'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time, that I frowned the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down

Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad

So sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like get Rihanna, chicka, Travie, I can handle that

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you
Heh heh heh

Appreciate every mixtape your friends make

Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, 
Jay:
I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see you and me

Nathan:
Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay

Make you glad you came

I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Travie McCoy
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Bruno Mars
Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?

For what?
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh

Travie McCoy
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
So bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Buy everything
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar

And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm tryin' hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now, I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate

Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?

I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? mmm, mmm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again

What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know (come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, this is it guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands

This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she call ""love""
But when I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from

Some terrible nights
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree

It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itchin'

To see the day
When everybody's words got in the way

All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar, what you gotta say?

Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

Tell the world that I'm coming

Yeah I never felt so strong
I'm feelin' like there's nothing that I can't try
(I'm back, baby)
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a life before, this one's for you
(And if you with me put your hands high)
And you, and you and you and you
(Your dreams are filled, you're rapping with the best)

I hear ""The Tears Of A Clown"", I hate that song
I feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone

What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry they mom?
(Why? Damn)
How do I respond?

What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Damn, but I ain't finished growin'
Another night the inevitable prolongs

Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

""A house Is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And people got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it

But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play boy, and we keep ballin'

Baby, we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own, pick up your phone, come on

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Till back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks

It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me, forgave me
For all of my shortcomings, welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming

Lot of fights, lot of scars
Lot of bottles, lot of cars
Lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog

And here I stand, a better man

Thank you Lord

For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't know what city I'm in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month

In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving

'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be all right in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let's go

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you
Gon' either wanna fight, when I get off this fuckin' mic or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothin' else I can do, 'cause

You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoked

Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin'

Just write it into an album
Seen it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no, so

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Got no reason 
Got no shame 
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear 
I'mma tell you everything

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

All my secrets away

All my secrets away"

1304,Sam Smith,I'm Not The Only One,"You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know,
And I know, and I know, and I don't know
I know I'm not the only one"

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Ah
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (lemme tell you)
When I see you again

Oh, oh, ooh

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Oh, oh, ooh
When I see you again

When I see you again"
1306,Sam Smith;John Legend,Lay Me Down,"Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright"

'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home

Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby
Oh, get a little more from you babe

You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

I'm waiting for something, always waiting

And then I give a little more, ooh babe
Oh, give a little more, ooh babe

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love

1309,Bruno Mars,When I Was Your Man,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"

To pull me back to the ground again

How did it, come so fast?

This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close

But tonight I need to hold you so close

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting back the stars are burning out

This is way too hard, 'cause I know
When the sun comes up, I will leave
This is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go

This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

Eminem:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder

Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8""

Bruno Mars:
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see

Royce da 5'9"":
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and
Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me ""Slow down, boy, you going to blow it""

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years

I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive

And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV Awards gag

Bruno Mars:
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine

'Cause this one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters"

So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you

Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following"

Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

1318,Zedd;Foxes,Clarity,"High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time

Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense

Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?

But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side till the day I die

Funny how we both end up free but everything seems all right
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

1322,Taylor Swift,Fifteen,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted, was to be wanted
Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen

We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to Paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones I can feel you

We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway

1324,5 Seconds of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never sleep away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things

Others are quietly going insane

Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

That maybe we found love right where we are

Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother (Hey!)
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
He's gonna save my life like Superman
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know

You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me"

Came from nothing, but knew we would ball

Waiting for hard work to pay off

We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you

Don't you give up

Let me love you

1343,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1344,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"
1345,Taylor Swift,Back To December,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was ""Goodbye""

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"

For these bright eyed honeys

Keep me up till the sun is high
Till the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me (you make a mess of me)

You'll be the death of me, the death of me

All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do (no matter what you do)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay

Oh, I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young, wild girls

Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go (I won't let go, oh no, no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just want to stay afloat

Someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know

Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?

I can't explain it

And I love the way your breath
Numbs me of Novocaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?

To get away from your parents
And I thought, ""Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought ""How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else""

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

So the bar is where I go

Drinking fast and then we talk slow

You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come, come on now follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much

Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

I got issues, you got 'em too
And one of them is how bad I need you

1363,Katy Perry;Skip Marley,Chained To The Rhythm,"Are we crazy
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white-picket fence
Like ornaments

So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb

So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Are we tone deaf
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can

So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song

Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm

Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
Who looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

Steal some covers, share some skin 
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable

That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 

That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 

Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
Paint a picture with my hands

Change the weather, still together when it ends

Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?

Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be all right
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

1372,Taylor Swift,Love Story,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

Oh, oh, oh

(The heart wants...)
(What the heart wants...)

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby..."

Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Saw you walk inside a bar

I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do

1376,Ed Sheeran,Castle on the Hill,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty, 'cause only your love can fill up my cup
So hold me
Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty and only your love can fill up my cup
'Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
'Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh

1381,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
1382,Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
1383,Shawn Mendes,There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,"I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause every time that she gets closer

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing

Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

She says that she is never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing

Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
If you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
If you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right

Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions

1384,Hoodie Allen;Ed Sheeran,All About It (feat. Ed Sheeran),"'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the lime light
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, ""Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front""
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
Young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold, not everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no

And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no"
1385,Taylor Swift,22,"It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.)
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping

1386,Ed Sheeran,Galway Girl,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Céilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"

1391,Taylor Swift,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say ""Never say never...""
 
...So he calls me up, and he's like, ""I still love you,"" and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

1393,Taylor Swift,Mine,"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now"
1394,Gotye;Kimbra,Somebody That I Used To Know,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know

But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alone without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say ""love, baby, let's go back to my flat""
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason so man, put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that

No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips, through my heartbeat thumb

And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say ""love, this is what is all about""
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

On the TV they said they had reported you dead
It was my fault 'cause I could've sworn that you said
It was easy to find another for your bed

How does it feel to leave me this way
When all that you have's been lost in a day?
Everyone knows, but not what to say
I've been wonderin' now

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now

When my eyes open morning pulls me into the view, no
I guess I'm only acting in the way that you do
Just being alone, no
Only time tells me more than I hope, all that I know is
I'll be finding a fortnight alone and behold
I know I shouldn't have let you go

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this

Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns

Breathe deep, bottle it up
So deep until it's all we got
Don't speak, just use your touch
Don't speak before we say too much

You hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
We scream and we shout
And make up the same day, same day

Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
Into you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

You get under my skin
More than anyone's ever been
But when we lay in bed
You hold me hard 'til I forget

That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
We scream and we shout
And make up the same day, same day

Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom

1403,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis;Grandmaster Caz;Grandmaster Melle Mel;Eric Nally;Kool Moe Dee,Downtown (feat. Melle Mel Grandmaster Caz Kool Moe Dee & Eric Nally),"I went to the moped store, said ""fuck it""
Salesman like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Oh it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
But on a seat, how can it be on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie own a Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
God damn man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'mma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stopping by pipe place, throwing fish to a player

Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep us safe
(Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(Downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
(Downtown)
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

Dope
Cut the bullshit
Get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw
Moped like a bullet (Oh)
You can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl in the back doing tandem
Because I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""who that is?""

It's me, the M the A-C the K
Stunting like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand, an eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""you need to slow down""
Going thirty-eight, damn, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn, and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to the shit player, Tiramisu, Tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag, but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep us safe
(Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(Downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards

Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're

1405,Maroon 5,Harder To Breathe,"How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seein' is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walkin' on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutchin' your pillow and writhin' in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

And when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Say, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill? Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting?
When you feel what I bring and you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Say, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?

It's holding on though the roads long
Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you going
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light

It can be so hard

You got everything to give right now

And yeah I know, how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)

Now payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
You fuckin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah

Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)

Being so bad got me feelin' so good
Showing you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Feeling inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns

If you talk, if you talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk that walk, baby
Oh yeah, talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk, that walk, baby
If you talk, if you talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk that walk, baby

1416,Panic! At The Disco,Death Of A Bachelor,"Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same

Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky, with the best of the best
Put my heart on my chest
So that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense
Of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off
It feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served

And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense
Of the death of a bachelor

The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?

At the expense

So take me down, take me down 
You hurt me, but do I deserve this? 
You make me so nervous 
Calm me down 
Calm me down

Wake you up, in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again 
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So come here and never leave this place 
Perfection of your face 
Slows me down 
Slows me down

So fall down 
I need you to trust me 
Go easy don't rush me 
Help me out why don't you help me out

Wake you up, in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again 
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So, you say go, it isn't working and I say no, it isn't perfect so I'll stay instead 
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it take it all, take all that I have 
I'd give it all away just to get you back 
And fake it fake it I'll take what I can get 
Knocking so loud can you hear me yet 
Try to stay away but you can't forget

Wake you up, in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again 
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So, you say go, it isn't working and I say no, it isn't perfect so I'll stay instead 
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it take it all take all that I have"

1419,Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow

Might be over now, but I feel it still

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies

We could wave until the walls come down

Kids in the middle, move over till it falls
Don't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?

Is it coming back?

Where it all began
It was a 102, nothin' to do
Man it was hot, so we jumped in
We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19, you + me

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
You said, let's just stay right here
Till the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be

1426,Paramore,The Only Exception,"When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darling

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Why don't you stand, stand by me? Oh, my darling, stand by me

I ain't find romance but you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling? We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots but you still got me hot
What happened to that feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop

We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together

They say that love can hit you so fast
And the odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk baby
Take me as I am or not

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

She had it all figured out
(Had it all figured out)
Well, I'll state something rash
She had the most amazing... smile
I bet you didn't expect that
She made me change my ways
(She made me change my ways)
With eyes like sunsets, baby
And legs that went on for days

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms, into your arms

She made her way to the bar
I tried to talk to her but she seemed so far (She seemed so far)
Outta my league (Outta my league)
I had to find a way to get her next to me

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms, into your arms

Ah she's slippin' away
I always freeze when I'm thinking of words to say
All the things she does
Make it seem like love
If it's just a game (If it's just a game)
Then I like the way that we play

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start

I'm falling in love

1431,Jason Mraz,I'm Yours,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate

This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"
1432,Kat Dahlia,I Think I'm In Love,"Time's been ticking, hearts are runnin'
Think that Cupid's up to somethin'
You asked me how I feel, I say nothin'
But lately color seems so bright
And the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light
I'm ignoring all the signs

I keep on frontin'
Yeah I stay bluffin'
I keep you wonderin', keep you huntin' for my lovin'
But I crave us huggin'
Yeah I stay stubborn
'Cause I can't admit that you got got all the strings
And know just how to tug 'em

I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

My heart's pacin', I'm confused, I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you, it's got me shakin'
I must be halucinatin'
I hear it happens, I'm just sayin'
Babe I'm just sayin'

Someone give me some paper
Someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child
I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust you when you say ""give me a hand""
Baby I'm fallin', I hope you catch me when I land

I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the dutchess
And your blunts are always loose so I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we getting so high, we always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches that turn into late lunches
And we ain't gotta label, we're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly and tell you do some crunches
And you say ""Yeah well your ass jiggles, go and do some lunges""
I say ""Fuck you"" while I'm thinking of you as my husband
I think I'm in love

I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
Baby I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
I think I'm in love again"

1434,Phillip Phillips,Home,"Hold on to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons

When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever

I could do this for eternity

1439,Frank Ocean,Thinkin Bout You,"A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)
How you feel (how you feel)
And though you were my first time
A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not if my spirit keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Till it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo"

To wind up drinking hot chocolate on the Soho floor

What's the point of wings if you never go anywhere?
I never wanna look at you and think of where we could've gone
And all that we should've done
So put your hands up

Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

I'm on my Marquise diamonds, I'm a Marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm
You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave, I won't, I won't

But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature

And any time we get our boys in up on the news
Ain't worried 'bout no press and ain't worried 'bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (whoo!)
Just made a bad miss without the ass shots (whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

In fact you tricked me
And I wasn't trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
'Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today

'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before

And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What's wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, oh
And I wasn't trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn't scared to fall again
But if you promise me you'll catch me
Then it's okay

'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore

Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming till I see you again
I'm not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
'Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I'm
Falling again
Falling again

And opened my doors

On the radio I don't wanna go
Come on, baby tell me
Something I wanna know
And I wanna see what is on my mind
Because this lack of motivation is
Taking over my time

I might never be the hand you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you anytime you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous 
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect, baby I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce 
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect, baby you're perfect
So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your break up songs about
Baby I'm perfect, baby we're perfect

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous 
If you like the do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect, baby I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce 
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect, baby you're perfect
So let's start right now"
1450,Parachute,What Side Of Love - Acoustic Version,-1
1451,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1452,The Spill Canvas,Lullaby,"It's the way that you blush when you're nervous.
It's your ability to make me earn this.
I know that you're tired, just let me sing you to sleep.
It's about how you laugh out of pity,
'Cause lets be honest I'm not really that funny.
I know that you're shy, just let me sing you to sleep.

If you need anything, just say the word.
I mean anything.
Rest assured, if you start to doze, then I'll tuck you in,
Plant my lips where your necklace is close.

It's those pills that you don't need to take,
Medicating perfection, now that's a mistake.
I know that you're spent, just let me sing you to sleep.
It's your finger and how I'm wrapped around it.
It's your grace and it keeps me grounded.
I know that you're weak, just let me sing you to sleep.

If you need anything, just the say the word.
I mean anything.
Rest assured, if you start to doze, then I'll tuck you in,
Plant my lips where your necklace is close.

While you were sleeping I figured out everything,
I was constructed for you, and you were molded for me.
Now I feel your name, coursing through my veins.
You shine so bright it's insane, you put the sun to shame.

(Oh)

If you need anything, just the say the word.
I mean anything. (I really do)
Rest assured, if you start to doze, then I'll tuck you in,
Plant my lips where your necklace is close.

If you need anything, just the say the word.
I mean anything.
Rest assured, if you start to doze, then I'll tuck you in,
Plant my lips where your necklace is close."
1453,A Rocket To The Moon,Wherever You Go,"An hour away from home
And time's never felt this slow
It feels like a week ago
Do you feel it too?

I bet you went back to bed
My pillow over neath your head
Repeating last words I've said
I miss you

You're all I need
So fall back to sleep

Wherever I go, wherever I'll be
Oh I just hope that you're thinkin' 'bout me
And that you don't doubt my love if you're lonely
Wherever you go, whatever you see
You're not alone, you never will be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be

I saw you in Thompson Square
The wind playing in your hair
(?)
You never bend

And now everywhere I go
It feels like I'm coming home
I'll see you in a month or so
But until then

You're all I need
And all I see

Wherever I go, wherever I'll be
Oh I just hope that you're thinkin' 'bout me
And that you don't doubt my love if you're lonely
Wherever you go, whatever you see
You're not alone, you never will be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be

Wherever I go, wherever I'll be
Oh I just hope that you're thinkin' 'bout me
And that you don't doubt my love if you're lonely
Wherever you go, whatever you see
You're not alone, you never will be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be
Oh baby just know, wherever you go
That's where I'll be"
1454,Ingrid Michaelson,The Way I Am,"If you were falling, then I would catch you
You need a light, I'd find a match

'Cause I love the way you say good morning
And you take me the way I am

If you are chilly, here take my sweater
Your head is aching; I'll make it better

'Cause I love the way you call me baby
And you take me the way I am

I'd buy you Rogaine when you start losing all your hair
Sew on patches to all you tear

'Cause I love you more than I could ever promise
And you take me the way I am
You take me the way I am
You take me the way I am"
1455,Jack Johnson,I Got You,"Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you

We went walking through the hills
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up
We can build a little home
But then the hell storm came and yelled,
""You need to let go, you've got no control. No.""

I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you

This weight's too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I've got you

And when tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I got you

I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you"
1456,Noah And The Whale,5 Years Time,"Oh well, in five years time we could be walking 'round a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through

And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun -so what the heck

'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh well, I look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say, ""Yeah, well I feel all pretty happy too.""
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it be Love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
And although not really, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time, I might not know you
In five years time, we might not speak at all
In five years time, we might not get along
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong

Oh, there'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go

There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love"
1457,Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros,That's What's Up,"I'll be the church, you be the steeple.
You be the king, I'll be the people.

While I was feeling such a mess,
I thought you'd leave me behind.
While I was being such a wreck,
I thought you'd treat me unkind.

But you helped me change my mind.
I'll be the sun, you be the shining.
You be the clock, I'll be the timing.

While I was feeling such a mess,
I thought you'd leave me behind.
While I was feeling so upset,
I thought the sun never shine.

Then I find forever
Hey! Hey! Love!
We've been best friends forever darling.
That's what's up!
Forever!
No matter what!

You've got my love to lean on darling.
That's what's up!
You've got my love to lean on darling.
No matter what!

You be the book, I'll be the binding.
You be the words, I'll be the rhyming.

While I was feeling such a wreck,
I thought of losing my mind.
While I was feeling such a mess,
I thought the sun never shine.

You be the bird, I'll be the feather.
We'll be the best of friends forever.

While I was feeling such a mess,
I thought you'd leave me behind.
When I was feeling such a wreck,
I thought you'd treat me unkind.
Then I found...

Forever! And always!
You've got my love to lean on darling.
All the days!
Forever!
Come with me!

You've got my love to lean on darling.
All the days!
You've got my love to lean on darling.
All the days
All of our days
Yeah...

Love is a shelter.
Love is a cause.
Love goes on forever.
Yeah, love will leads us all.

Love! It is our honor.
Love! It is our all.
Love goes on forever.
Yeah, love it is our home.

Oh yeah!
Yeah! That's what's up!
Oh yeah!
That's what's up!
Yeah that's what's up!"
1458,Panic! At The Disco,Impossible Year,"There's no sunshine
This impossible year
Only black days and sky gray
And clouds full of fear

And storms full of sorrow
That won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons
This impossible year

There's no good times
This impossible year
Just a beach front of bad blood
And a coast that's unclear

All the guests at the party
They're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude
This impossible year

There's no you and me
This impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak
And gin made of tears

The bitter pill is swallowed
The scar souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise
This impossible year

There's never air to breathe
There's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on
Past the dream

There's no sunshine
There's no you and me
There's no good times
This impossible year"
1459,Rachel Platten,Speechless,"Shhh...

Why does this part always go fast?
And I really want this to last so bad
Words distract us, but we know the truth
So hush, baby, my heart's speaking to you

Just gimme that touch, I want it
Quit talking so much, I'm ready
Stop moving your lips and kiss me
Keep taking my breath away

'Cause you make me speechless
You quiet my demons
So why don't we hold tonight and just kill me silently
I don't need a reason
When you make me speechless
We're getting loud tonight, we're allowed tonight to be

C'mon baby, make me speechless
C'mon baby, make me

Body language screaming everything
And keep giving it to me, fire away

Just gimme that touch, I want it
Quit talking so much, I'm ready
Stop moving your lips and kiss me
Keep taking my breath away

'Cause you make me speechless
You quiet my demons
So why don't we hold tonight and just kill me silently
I don't need a reason
When you make me speechless
We're getting loud tonight, we're allowed tonight to be
C'mon baby, make me speechless

When you touching me, when you're kissing me
Nothing left to say
I'm speechless, get ahold of me, kill me silently
Nothing left to say

'Cause you make me speechless
You quiet my demons
So why don't we hold tonight and just kill me silently
I don't need a reason
When you make me speechless
We're getting loud tonight, we're allowed tonight to be

C'mon baby, make me speechless
C'mon baby, make me shhh
C'mon baby, make me speechless
Don't say a word
C'mon baby, make me"

Pretty boy, don't be shy
Like all your bad ideas
Ain't this a nice surprise to find a man so dear
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Say you'll be my baby and I'll be your girl and
You can have this heart of mine,
'Cause I would walk a thousand miles
Just to make you smile

You taste like sugar mints and cigarettes and beer
I used to hate this town but I'll stay because you're here
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
All them skinny girls are bitter and reserved
If you want a lot of love then I'm just what you deserve

Say you'll be my baby and I'll be your girl and

1462,Ellie Goulding,Devotion,"Open up and let me in
Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you

Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Tell me what you dream about
I lose you in my sleep, somehow
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always there for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see

Whenever you break I'll fix it for you

And maybe we'll fall a little deeper

1463,Alessia Cara,I'm Yours,"Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I'm beautiful
'Cause I wasn't looking for love no
Nobody asked to get me attached to you
In fact you tricked me
And I wasn't trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
'Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today

'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours

I'm mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What's wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, oh
And I wasn't trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn't scared to fall again
But if you promise me you'll catch me
Then it's okay

'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours

Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming till I see you again
I'm not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
'Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I'm
Falling again
Falling again

But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours"
1464,Halsey,Empty Gold,"I, I must confess
How hard I tried to breathe
Through the trees of loneliness
And you, you must confess
How hard you need to see
Through the heart beating out my chest

Feel like we've been falling down
Like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold

Dark as midnight sun
Smoke as black as charcoal
Fills into our fragile lungs
'Cause when our demons come
Dancing in the shadows
To a game that can't be won

Feel like we've been falling down
Like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let Winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold

We're the underdogs in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

We're the underdogs in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
We will walk away from empty gold"

Doing it up like Midas, mmm
Now you say I got a touch, so good, so good
Make you never wanna leave, so don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

I'm on my Marquise diamonds, I'm a Marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm
You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave, I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I here, I know she feelin' for it through
And any time we get our boys in up on the news
Ain't worried 'bout no press and ain't worried 'bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (whoo!)
Just made a bad miss without the ass shots (whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

1475,Lady Gaga,Million Reasons,"You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey, eh, eh, ey
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, eh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay"

It's been a week since you hit my bed

Never thought that I'd reboot, but you're a different kind of new

It's like I feel everything more
(I forget to)
All my body knows it when you reach my floor
My heart is beating down the door
Now I'm stocking up on oxygen

'Cause when I see you
I forget to breathe-eathe-eathe
I forget to breathe-eathe-eathe
I forget to breathe-eathe-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you

If I could just inhale some chill
It's like I'm living out in space
How am I still here?
Did you slip me a magic pill?
Got me lifted like an astronaut
No helmet on and my lungs just stop

So please, when you look at me like that
(Like that)
There's no way to fight back
(Fight back, no)
Please, can't you see I'm stocking up on oxygen?

It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Rolling dice, or staying out till three

For money, fame for power, out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go

And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me

When the skies are gray and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we've spoiled the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

1481,Mumford & Sons,I Will Wait,"Well, I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way shake the excess

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind freed from the lies

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground, woo

We'll raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you"

You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high

It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you

And love is a funny thing
It's making my blood flow with energy
And it's like an awakened dream
As what I've been wishing for, is happening
And it's right on time

Oh ain't it nice this life, we've got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
When you love someone

We're gonna give ourselves to love tonight
Lifting up to touch the starlight
And we will savor every second
We suspend together
You and I will
You and I will
You and I will

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you"

How to be brave, how can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone, all of my doubt suddenly goes away
Somehow, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
Standing in front of me, every breath
Every hour has come to this, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more, one step closer, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more"

That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go
I always know
'Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while"
1492,Meghan Trainor;John Legend,Like I'm Gonna Lose You,"I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows

We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know

So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets

So let's take our time to say what we want
Here's what we got before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

Hey
Whoa

I'm gonna love you (oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you babe)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you"
1493,John Mayer,Your Body Is a Wonderland,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland"
1494,Bruno Mars,Just the Way You Are,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

1495,Train,Drops of Jupiter,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?"

1497,Train,Meet Virginia,"She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day
Oh, wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful?
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her lies
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite, unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Meet Virginia- I can't wait to
Meet Virginia- Yeah-ey eh eh eh eh

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her lies
Pulls her hair back as she screams

I don't really wanna be the Queen
I don't really wanna live this"

But I'll be alright

My head's underwater

To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real

That somebody like you could be with
Someone like me

You're lookin' so fresh
It's catching my eye
Why, oh why, did I not see this before,
The girl I adore was right in front of me?
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
And ask why it took so long to see
We're meant to be

On the boulevard
Something like a sunset

Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours"

I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?"", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints with my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7 Eleven
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic till my voice hoarse

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good

1513,Jason Derulo,Marry Me,"A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?
Baby I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
'Cause I have you, girl I have you
So get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be
Better, better
The day when I say

I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

You're the only image in my mind, so I still see you around...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
Said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right, but I still mean them... Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to... Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...

1520,Dave Hollister,One Woman Man,"All right, (hmm)
It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
'Cause everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Ooh, and now
(See now that I found the love of my life)
(I don't have to trick no more)
Girl, it was nice seein' you
But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Chorus to fade"

That will always have your heart

Know that you're that one for me

Ooh baby, ooh you'll always be my boo

I don't know 'bout y'all
But I know about us and uh
This is the only way
We know how to rock

I don't know 'bout y'all
But I know about us and uh
It's the only way
We know how to rock

Do you remember girl
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember girl
I was the one who said put your lips like this

Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
Girl I was there when you were my baby

It started when we were younger
You were mine, my boo, my boo
Now another brother's taking over
But it's still in your eyes, my boo
Even though we used to argue, it's alright
(It's alright, girl)
I know we haven't seen each other
In a while but you will always be my boo

I was in love with you when we were younger
You were mine, my boo
And I see it from time to time
I still feel like my boo

And I can see it no matter
How I try to hide, my boo
Even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Yes I remember boy
'Cause after we kissed
I could only think about your lips
Yes I remember boy
The moment I knew you were the one
I could spend my life with

Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
I was there and you were my baby

It started when we were younger
You were mine, my boo
Now another brother's taking over
But it's still in your eyes, my boo

Even though we used to argue, it's alright
I know we haven't seen each other
In a while but you will always be my boo

I was in love with you when we were younger
You were mine, my boo
And I see it from time to time
I still feel like my boo

And I can see it no matter
How I try to hide my boo
Even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

My oh, my oh, my oh, my oh, my my boo
My oh, my oh, my oh, my oh, my boo

It started when we were younger
You were mine, my boo
Now another brother's taking over
But it's still in your eyes, my boo

Even though we used to argue, it's alright
(It's alright, it's okay)
I know we haven't seen each other
In a while but you will always be my boo

I don't know 'bout y'all
But I know about us and uh
This is the only way
We know how to rock

I don't know 'bout y'all
But I know about us and uh
This is the only way
We know how to rock"

Telling my whole life with his words

I felt he found my letters, and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on

1542,Jennifer Hudson,Spotlight,"Are you a man who loves, and cherishes, and cares for me?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Or are you a guard in a prison of maximum security?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Do we stay home all the time, cause you want me all to yourself?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Or am I locked away out of fear that I'll find someone else?
(Is that you? Is that you?)

Well I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry

Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs, as well as mine?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you)
Or is this just my sentence, am I doing time?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you)
If this is love (real, real love), then I'm staying no doubt
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you)
But if I'm just love's prisoner, then I'm busting out!
(Is that you? Is that you?)

Baby I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry

Oh, you oughta be ashamed of yourself!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Loving me, loving me so wrong
Baby all I do is try, to show you that you're my
One and only guy
No matter who may come along
Open your eyes cause baby I don't like...

Hey, 'cause I don't like

I really love him 'cause he's everything I want
He listens to me, cares for me so I truly believe

God sent me an angel from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect only because
It's the only way I can describe, so

If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby

I'm selfish 'cause I don't wanna share him with nobody
Not even those people that came before me
But see, I never believed

God would send me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect only because
It's the only way I can describe, so

If this isn't love, tell me what it is

I know I ain't tripping
I know I ain't slipping
I know that it's love

You see me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming
I know I ain't dreaming
'Cause this is the reason I love him because
If this isn't love

If this isn't love, tell me what it is

1544,Ne-Yo;Jennifer Hudson,Leaving Tonight,"[Featuring Jennifer Hudson]
Ne-Yo talking:
I believe that love and trust are one in the same
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt
No matter what this person sayin', that person
You believe your man
Now you say you love me, but every time one of your little friends come at you with something
We gotta do this
Mama I'm tryin', I'm trying to show you that I'm for real
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you

Jennifer Hudson talking:
Just shut up and listen

Verse 1 - Jennifer Hudson:
Two hundred and sixteen
That's how many times that I went
Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is
There's something about it
That don't feel right

(Bridge 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo))
Said today she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me

(Chorus 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo))
You're leaving tonight
Out of my life
Everyone said you ain't no good
Then you prove them right
You're leaving tonight
It's over and done
Ain't no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes
(You're leaving tonight)

(Verse 2 - Ne-Yo)
Baby now hold up
Lets just settle down
'Cause there's a perfect explanation
To this situation
That we're goin' through
(This thing that we're goin' through)
I swear I don't know that girl
But I seen her 'round
And she's expressed how much she want it
But baby I'm not lonely
All of me is around you

(Bridge 2 - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson))
Said I got a girl like a thousand times
(So you counted)
She kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Please believe I'm telling the truth
(I really doubt it)
Really wish you would believe in me

(Chorus 2 - Ne-Yo)
I'm not leaving tonight
Girl you're my life
All of your friends think I'm no good
Please don't prove them right
I'm not leaving tonight
It's over and done
Let's leave this alone, and lets make love
Till the morning come
(Not leaving tonight)

(Bridge 3 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo))
Oh I won't deny
That everything in my body
Wants to know that you're the one
(So what's the problem girl?)
See I can't take this serious when you're just having fun
(No, I'm not just having fun)
Steady running around making a fool of me
(Baby girl you can't listen to everyone
I'm your man, trust in me
Don't let them interfere with us being happy)

(Breakdown - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo))
(Love me girl)
I love you, that's a fact
(Say that you love me baby)
But I'll be dammed if ima let you up and disrespect who's been there from the start
(You not gon disrespect my heart)
You claim to not know (not know that girl)
But her name and number is in your phone
She even got a ringtone
You care to explain that part?

(Bridge 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo))
Said today she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Please don't worry 'bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me

(Chorus 3 - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson))
I'm not leaving tonight
Girl you're my life
(Everyone said you ain't no good
And you prove them right)
I'm not leaving tonight
(It's over and done)
Just leave us alone
And lets make love
Till the morning come
Not leaving tonight

(Outro - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson))
Said I just need you to trust me
(I wanna trust you)
Not leaving tonight"

1546,Jennifer Hudson;Ne-Yo;Rick Ross,Think Like A Man,"You gotta act like a woman
And think like a a man

Why you call me your dream babe
And foolish of me I believe that
You said every king needs his queen babe
That's why you needed me, baby

Right in between lust and love
You go and mess things up
Now there's no we, babe
There's just you and there's me, baby

There was us, there was trust
There was happen and change, I know
Silly you, silly me, silly us
What a waste

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man

Now I'm gonna keep it realer with you, now than I ever been
Wish we would never been, girl, we was better friends
You didn't had to tell me what where, why and when
Ooh, I didn't need it 'cause you wasn't my girlfriend

We had a good thing, you would come by and kick it
Ooh give me that good thang, then after we was finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what ever hell made us think this wanna gon' be better

And now I'm telling you lies all because I hate to see
The tears in your eyes, of course I want my cake and eat it too
I'm a guy and of course you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man in love

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man

Time cost money and it's so expensive
Versace, Lenny got these women blowing kisses
Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic
Can I take a picture, she's my Mona Lisa

Living like a princess in a fairy tale
You know them people up in Barney, show and tell
Bentley backin' out of Neiman and I see no ponytail
5 karat yellow diamond, you don't know me well

Penthouse, set the drunks out on Collins Ave
She caught an atitude, I had to call a cab
You don't understand, it's altitude I'm balling at
I'm at the game on the wood, where the owners at

So different but the same, boy you taught me everything
Yeah, you show me how to think, you're the only one to blame
It's such a shame, yeah, should lost the game
You tell me how to play

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man"

Ain't you glad I'm still around
So glad you're still the one
And heaven knows it's good to be home
Oh, I made it back for your love

I hate to go but that's the way I make us a living
When I get home, all my best I will be giving
Oh, but to know all the loving that we share
Though you're deep down in my soul
You were wishin' your body's not there

Ain't you glad I made it back
Ain't you glad I'm still around

1555,Jennifer Hudson;Ne-Yo;Rick Ross,Think Like A Man,"You gotta act like a woman
And think like a a man

Why you call me your dream babe
And foolish of me I believe that
You said every king needs his queen babe
That's why you needed me, baby

Right in between lust and love
You go and mess things up
Now there's no we, babe
There's just you and there's me, baby

There was us, there was trust
There was happen and change, I know
Silly you, silly me, silly us
What a waste

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man

Now I'm gonna keep it realer with you, now than I ever been
Wish we would never been, girl, we was better friends
You didn't had to tell me what where, why and when
Ooh, I didn't need it 'cause you wasn't my girlfriend

We had a good thing, you would come by and kick it
Ooh give me that good thang, then after we was finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what ever hell made us think this wanna gon' be better

And now I'm telling you lies all because I hate to see
The tears in your eyes, of course I want my cake and eat it too
I'm a guy and of course you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man in love

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man

Time cost money and it's so expensive
Versace, Lenny got these women blowing kisses
Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic
Can I take a picture, she's my Mona Lisa

Living like a princess in a fairy tale
You know them people up in Barney, show and tell
Bentley backin' out of Neiman and I see no ponytail
5 karat yellow diamond, you don't know me well

Penthouse, set the drunks out on Collins Ave
She caught an atitude, I had to call a cab
You don't understand, it's altitude I'm balling at
I'm at the game on the wood, where the owners at

So different but the same, boy you taught me everything
Yeah, you show me how to think, you're the only one to blame
It's such a shame, yeah, should lost the game
You tell me how to play

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man"

Now I'm flyin like an airplane
Now I'm ridin' on the open range
Now I'm livin' out my destiny
I know the truth,

For the first time
I can stand in front of someone
Finally
I can be me
I can just let my love spill over
I can cry
I don't have to lie
I can finally let someone all the way inside
All the way
All they way

1558,Jennifer Hudson,Where You At,"You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you'd protect me
From heartache, pain, lies, loneliness, and misery
You said you'd tear down the walls that were in my way
You promised things would be okay
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you, but you never showed

Where you at? Oh, where you at? Oh, where you at?
Boy you say would be here for me
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)

Now you said you go to church
Stop slanging, find a real job, and go to work
And you say you stay out of the streets
And spend more time with me
Take away my doubts and fears and fulfill my dreams
You said you'd be that shoulder for my eyes to cry on
Said you would be that one that I could depend on
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you, but you never showed

Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at?
Boy you say would be here for me
Where you at? (Where)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)

And oh false promises is much like fake named
You painted a picture for me but there was no frame
You made my future look bright and I believed every word
I went to sleep on the clouds and woke up in the dirt
And now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing
You say you'd be there for me boy when the tough got going
Said if weapons draw, you'd stand in front of me
Whenever I fell trapped, said you'd be the one to set me free
Thought you were my hero
But as it turns out you a no show
Tell me where

Where you at? (you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at babe?)
Where you at?
Oh you said would be there for me
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Baby where you at?)
Where you at?
You said you'd be right there for me
Where you at? (And I can't)

Where you at? (See, See)
Where you at? (See)

You'd said you'd be right there for me"
1559,Jennifer Hudson,Invisible,"Seems like I'm not here
It's like I don't mean nothing
Like glass unclear
Almost like you can see straight through me
I got questions but no answers
So tired of being confused and I
Don't wanna stay right here and I
Gotta find my wings and fly

I gotta find me another way
'Cause I don't wanna stay another day
Time for a change in my mind
I'v opened my eyes I'm changing my life
And now I'm gonna live my life for me
Cause this ain't how it's supposed to be
No more standing in the back of the line
'Cause I'm invisible for the last time

Why can't you see me
Do I really even matter
You changed me completely
And I remember how it used to be
I got question what's the lesson
I'm tired of being confused and I'm
I'm gonna take my chance and fly
I'm taking back my life

This can't be it for me
This can't be all I'm made for
And all my time wasted in this life
It's my time to shine
No more feeling insufficient
I'm gonna make my own decisions
It don't matter what you can or cannot see
I'm doing this for me

Can you see me
I know you see me
No more stand in the back of the line
'Cause I'm invisible for the last time"

See these same two eyes, see these same two feet
I remember you, You who I used to be
You still look the same, but you don't hurt like me
Look at my reflection, somewhere my affection
Disappeared, isn't here, nothing left to say
Memories they fading, but I'm the one who makes them
But I keep the love close to enough to say

What if this life is all that we're given
We just can't stop living, scared of what we see
'Cause in this world, anything can hurt you
They push you, then forget you
Stole my history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me

I tell you what my name is
And ain't nothing gon' change it
'Cause what you are is what you are
Even if your memory's flawed
I go to places, trying to find familiar faces
They don't show, but I still know
They don't have to look for me
I dream about, I dream about
The place where all the broken pieces fit together

'Cause in this world, anything can hurt you
They push you, then forget you
And stole my history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me

Now all that's left of these hands, this breathe
I've said goodbye to so many things that tears wont cry
And I take this pain, This joy, and rain
'Cause all that matters now is
In this life anything can hurt you
Push you, then forget you
Erase your history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for awhile, asked him how hes been Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself


(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still In love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) and it's killing me cause, now I know
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still In love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself


(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still In love with you

(Truth is) and when it's all said and done, Guess I'm still In love with you

Now the truth is, it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
'Cause I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing with my mind (because I know)

You know you gotta be my girl) x4

If you ever see her
If you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Here without her"
1568,Christina Aguilera,Fighter,"After all you put me through
You think I'd despise you
But in the end I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up, 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joyride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, oh, oh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Oho, oho
Oho, oho
Ohohoho, yeaheaheah
Aha

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game

I heard you're going around
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hurt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, aha, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies
Disguise yourself through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought I would forget
But I, I remember, ohohohoho
Yes, I remember, ohoho
I remember!

Thought I would forget, ooohooohooo
I remember, ohoho
Yes, I remember, ohoho!
I remember!

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
Thanks for making me a fighter"

We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't want to give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down

Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made our mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all
At all

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind

Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone

1571,Usher,U Got It Bad,"Oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm-)

Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad, hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
(Look at yourself)
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about

You make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you

And how you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
What's sad is that I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do
(Should I) Tell my baby bye-bye
(Should I) Do exactly what I feel inside
('Cause I) I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
See what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (ooh baby)
Start a new relationship with you this is what you do
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

You make me wanna
You make me wanna (oh you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (ooh don't baby, don't baby, do things)
You make me wanna

I needed someone to lift my spirits up, so I drooped in on a dance
Just to take a glance and there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough, I asked her for her hand
Said would you like to dance, so pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand, and we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam
Oh

Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet On a slow jam
For my baby and for me

Seems what you say is true, I feel the same way too
You see I waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand, I knew you were the man
To turn my world around, and make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes made me realize that everything I feel has got to
Be real
And we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam

Usher:
I've been trying to find someone who I can give my good lovin' to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone

1583,Lil Wayne,How To Love,"Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

Ooh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love"

Send it right back 2 U

Your inner view to me is
Something that I do desire
Struggling 2 see a new something that I fantasize
So I'm sending
U can't disguise your emotions
U know that I see in your eyes
U soul's, your soul's somethin' that I feel inside
Run, run, run, run if I run Lord only knows how far that I
And I will fall behind
Gotta find a better place, gotta find a better space
So that I, so my life may be the reason why

Hold on be strong, 4 your own
Move on b4 long, you'll get home
If your feeling insecure
U can be sure, Even if it take forever and a day for me 2 do
I gotta send it on 2 U
Tell me what will I do
Send it right back 2 U"

That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

I gotta go downstairs
Everybody waiting down there for me

But I roll over into your curly hair
And sexy body, oh so nice and curvy
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up baby, let me get it one more time
Before, before, before

I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
That's when you wrap them legs around me
And I fall victim to that lazy love

Oh, you got that, I don't wanna

Even though I'm about two hours late
But I can't help it man
If they knew what I know, they would understand

I'm washing last night off, time to boss up
When suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch
She's right behind me
Water glisten off her body

Looking at me, like ""One more time.""
But baby I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you

Wish we would never been, girl, we was better friends
You didn't had to tell me what where, why and when
Ooh, I didn't need it 'cause you wasn't my girlfriend

We had a good thing, you would come by and kick it
Ooh give me that good thang, then after we was finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what ever hell made us think this wanna gon' be better

And now I'm telling you lies all because I hate to see
The tears in your eyes, of course I want my cake and eat it too
I'm a guy and of course you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man in love

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man

Time cost money and it's so expensive
Versace, Lenny got these women blowing kisses
Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic
Can I take a picture, she's my Mona Lisa

Living like a princess in a fairy tale
You know them people up in Barney, show and tell
Bentley backin' out of Neiman and I see no ponytail
5 karat yellow diamond, you don't know me well

Penthouse, set the drunks out on Collins Ave
She caught an atitude, I had to call a cab
You don't understand, it's altitude I'm balling at
I'm at the game on the wood, where the owners at

So different but the same, boy you taught me everything
Yeah, you show me how to think, you're the only one to blame
It's such a shame, yeah, should lost the game
You tell me how to play

But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man"

I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes

If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please

Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

Looking like Treyvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted

She on my wanted poster, ciroc in my mimosa
I'm ballin' like LeBron, we shoppin' in Milan
The four fifty eight Ferrari I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb

But I got experience
Don't mind trecking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No buts, or dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby going deeper ain't gon kill me
And I know they are shagging for me
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No buts, or dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby
You'll be my place tonight, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew i, don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

What happened to you yeah
From the beginning to where I was getting
But I was with it, and I'll admit that
She was clear it was a kinda thing
It woulnd't be easy for me to let it go
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time
I got a head someone got left behind
The world is yours, your sign is that aligned
And in no time, I hear, money clouds fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to France, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fainted 'cause I miss you
Give me your bag
But the issue this we can get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
'Cause I miss you, give me your bag
What happened to you
What happened to you

Did what I wanted, freaked out the honies
I stayed only mine, mine was on the money
Pack whatever, whenever hot tub forever
Black young and clever

When you give it up, you get it on
Love would be the only reason to look back
And when you turn it on, you can't turn it on
But picture me complaining the notice
Money clouds fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to France, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fainted 'cause I miss you
Give me your bag
But the issue this we can get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
'Cause I miss you, give me your bag
What happened to you
What happened to you

What sense does it make to have everything and nothing
At the same time...
Where are you
I need you, yeah
I'm looking for you, girl, come and share all these

Money clouds fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to France, many women

You can say I've made it
But I've fainted 'cause I miss you

1608,Usher,Numb,"They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill only makes you stronger
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

I can feel you now

Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?

I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb

I can feel you now (numb, numb)
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now

But you can't feel it, do ya? (numb)

Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore (numb)

I can feel you now (numb)
I can feel you now (numb)

Can you feel it?"
1609,Usher,Lessons For The Lover,"Turn the light on!
How could someone hurt you
But still make you feel so good?
How the screaming...

You stand there and let them good
Just 'cause he gives you pain,
That don't mean he ain't the one!
Fuck you at your brain, you'll be smiling when he's done

So my advice would be
No, don't leave, don't go so easy!
Let the argue... turn you on!
It's worthy!

And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
Lesson for the lover, for lover!
Lesson for the love, oh lover!

So hard to imagine living life without them there
'Cause now you're so cut out in the passion
But this shit is beyond compare, yeah!
'Cause... make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drug
You fought hard, but think about how hard you come

So my advice would be
No, don't leave, don't go so easy!
Let the argue... turn you on!
It's worthy!

And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day

Lesson for the love, oh lover!

No one wants to be fighting all day, love, all night, love
So we just scream to wish... making up
Yeah, and as time goes on we're feeling ok, babe, all right, love
And we'll forget about it in the morning, oh, oh!

And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye

You learn all these lessons when you're in love
Lesson for the lover, for lover!
(Turn the lights on!)
Lesson for the love, oh lover!"
1610,Usher,Euphoria,"Reintroduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah I been running but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You made my heartbeat keep pumping
Why it ain't turning up so loud

Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear the thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are
(Buildup)
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
(Break beats)
Here we are, we are, we are, we are

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I've seen for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

I went in all the way and thought I could get in and out
She said relax, you gonna be here for a while
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is I'm learning to loving
And I ain't gonna turn it down

The fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear the thief
Once the music takes you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are
(Buildup)
Here we are, we are, we are

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time

But I got something to tell ya, listen

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while

See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

But you remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through (oh no no no)
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone but me
This is why we could never be

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (gotta let you go)

Meanwhile I...

Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

You don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'ma be all right tonight

Your face is saying why
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me
Listenin' to friends
Now it's the endin'
Then again, no story can end without it
Damn I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

Gonna boogie tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home
Waiting for love
So tonight
I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party

(Oh yeah

It's OK, girl
Sick and tired of staying at home

Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried
I worked hard to provide
All the material things
That I thought that would make you happy
I'm confused can you make me understand
'Cause I tried to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool maybe I was blind
But never took time to see

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
Without you my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

(Oh girl) I need you come back home (you know I need you) I don't want to be alone

Girl, I put your love up on the shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now your not around
I wish for every moment in time
That I wasted we used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide please take my hand
Want you to know that
I got you if you need it
I don't want to be on the outside looking in
I got to have you girl, can't you see

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
Cause without you my whole world is falling apart
And without you I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

(Oh girl) I need you come back home (you know I need you) I don't want to be alone

(Please stay don't go) Give me another chance I want to be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading
I'll do anything for your love
Would you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
I don't understand
Girl I just a man
Help me
Can help me
Without you my whole world is falling apart
And without you girl I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love

Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Girl, I'll never stop because you're all I got
Can you help me?
Help me understand why I can't be your man

How do I say?

A foreign beauty, so exotic
When she smiled at me
She took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say...

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful
When I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby, how do I say, how do I say?

How do I say?

The room was filled with her sweet aroma
When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
In the language that I never will forget

I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd till she found me
Then she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
All my life I've never felt quite like this
I've never had a loss for words
One kiss from her has got me speechless

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful
When I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you

Ma cherie, how do I say, how do I say?

Baby lets engage in a deep conversation
In the body language we speak won't need any translation
An odyssey of physical pleasure
As we explore, together this universal language
Of love (love, my love, my love, my love, etc.)
Can you tell me how do I put it into words?

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful
When I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you

Is time for U-turn... U heard me
You're either with us or against us. Yo!
It's been some years now,
Since we hit the floor to get down.
We always had a step to go with the sound.
Now everybody wanna sit around drink and ball.
Remember the snake,
And how the floor used to clear,
Everybody would break.
What's krunk now,
Used to be called gettin' to it
I'm bringing it all back.
This is how we do it.
Just...

Chorus: (Repeat 2x)

Put your hands up,
Bend your knees.
Bounce around in a circle,
Get down wit me. OH!
Come on, come on,
It's not hard to learn.
Come on come on it's called the U-Turn.

In the 80's, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doin' the moonwalk.
In the 90's I had a high flat top.
Doin' the wop,
Pee- wee to the reebok
I can't forget about my high-school days,
The sound was Bobby Brown,
The dance was the running man.
Everybody wanna push Bently's.
The year is 2,
Everybody do the U- Turn.

All you need to do.
All you gotta do,
Is let the tempo take over you.
I came to have a good time.
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul,
Let it lead ya to the floor.
Oh come on...

3 in the Benz, 3 in the truck
On... 85 headed to the Plush
Ten minutes later when we pulled up
I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims
Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems
Proceeded to walk in
Just then I saw this
Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris
With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew...

U R the one
I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man take my hand, girl
U R the one
Girl I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

Said, I know you got a few with u
Don't even trip I got my crew here too
Keep it real what you wanna do
I really wanna chill with u
Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz
But if we split up maybe we can hook up again
U never know I guess that all depends
If I can get you from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0

So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell ya girls c'mon let's go, 'cause

Let me start by saying that the way I
Feel for you has never once changed
And the games I've played, mistakes I made
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know

We got a problem, baby, I can't lie 'cause lately I realize
That I never knew that we was on the same playing field
Knew that it was wrong but we let it be
And I know you never knew when you said, ""I do""
That you would have to face all the pain you feel

Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess it's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And then spotlight feel like the bright light
But it's really just my fears and it still don't dry your tears

When I, say she ain't you and I really love you more
When you say if it's true why'd you do it for?
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

And there's no way to deny that my heart is a time bomb
With seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows

That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what am, I will be

Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl and I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?

Is maybe that you might

And love's floating away

Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
Want to feel burning flames when you say my name
Want to feel passion flow into my bones
Like blood through my veins

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And, baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Slowly slowly you run for me,
But do you know me at all?
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No no no no no)
If you don't wanna try
(Just try sometimes)
But all that I've been thinking of
(I just think)
Is maybe that you might

Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

Big Sean:
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

Ariana:
Break up, make up, total waste of time;
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hmm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hmm, hold on, yeah.

(Sean:)
You're, you're, you're, you're,
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

You're, you're, you're, you're,
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)

1625,Ariana Grande,My Everything,"I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him...
To think that I was wrong;
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone...
Pain is just a consequence of love;
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us...

He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling,
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure...
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...

You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

You are, you are, you are...
You are, you are, you are... my everything..."

1632,TQ,Westside,"This is going out to the whole wide Westside,
Know what I'm sayin', yeah,
Brake it down for me,
Steady mop rock, rock on

I was just a young boy living the hood city (eastside Compton G)
Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy had every nigga talkin' about
Boy you can't fuck with me remember Ice T had the power (oh, we)
Hear gunshots Llickin by the hour
With Too short bumpin every supersport and
Taught us all how to ride for the West coast

To my people's if you wit me where you at
Throw your dubs in the air
Wave them like you just don't care
From L.A. to the bay what's ya say
All day every day any damn day
Take a look around we got the whole world locked down
Going on and on and don't stop won't stop, can't stop either ride or die
That's why I put it down for the Westside

Didn't seem that long ago (oh, no)
We were stealin 40's out the liquor store (oh, no)
Momma started trippin' so it's time to go
Out to the park wit the locsters (huh)
Everybody broke smokin' roaches.
D.J. Quick was the shit had every nigga claming
He was from the CPT
Ya remember one time tried to clown
We had to burn this bitch on down.

One time for niggas in incarceration
I blaze a dime for you for havin' lots of patience
Two times for my sisters at the county building
I got some westside love for all your ghetto children
Three times for my niggas that have passed away
I tip some gin for you and pray for better days
One day everything's going to be fine,
But until that day my only reply is Westside till I die.

Going on and on and don't stop won't stop, can't stop either ride or die
Got to give it up to the Westside.

From Crenshaw to Foothill Boulevard all I see is
Low low's in my cars, Daytons and Five stars
All the true hoes is hittin switches and
All the finest riches of course the bombest bitches don't get it
Twisted.
Ask me what's a real G, show me a nigga scraping back
Against the wall until his knuckles bleed. (knuckles bleed)
Screaming death to all my enemies
And those who don't believe
Westcoast living be the shit to me

How could I ever treat my baby that way

I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at

You got me twisted

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know you want my lovin' baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know, I can make you feel real good if you let me baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know you want my lovin' baby"
1639,Boyz II Men,End Of The Road,"Spoken:
Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together and you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' it 'round and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me, you just don't realize
You've never been there before, it's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm going to do)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Spoken:
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out and cheat at night, just like you did baby
But that's alright, (Huh) I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you just come back to me
(Lonely) Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts baby
(Lonely) I feel pain too
Baby please

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Although we've come, to the end of the road  (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no, no no)
It's unnatural (No no no no no no) you belong to me
I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come, (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my god, help me out of this baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Although we've come, to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Alright, alright alright)
It's unnatural (It's unnatural), you belong to me (You belong to me)
I belong to you (I belong to you, whoa)

Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no, no no)
It's unnatural (No no no no no no), you belong to me, I belong to you"

Little mama, it'll be alright
I just wanna be all on you
Do it till we both can't move

1642,Trey Songz,Heart Attack,"We share, somethin' so charming, still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls

Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack

It's killing me, swear I never cried so much,
'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time, that I frowned the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down

Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts, 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to

That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up

Down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be

Making love faces, making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin'
Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and
Making love faces, making love faces
My hands rubbin' on your skin

So happy every since I found you
Just like a kid who found some candy
Let me feel and find your panties

Take 'em off take 'em off
Take 'em off please

She a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
Man shorty like to energize up
She just wanna ride, she ain't never tired
She cooking naked, eggs and some bacon
After I eat that I treat that then eat that again, and again, and again
I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy
I don gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
And me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Yes, all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

Posted up in that 305
Yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

1652,Trey Songz,Y.A.S.,"She giving me the side eye, saying she ain't staying over here
Each and every time I let her down like I didn't care
Guess I got used to hearing whatever I wanted to hear
Guess I got used to feeling, like you supposed to give it here
She said she thought I was different, but now she could see it clear

Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this...
""You ain't shit"", ""you ain't shit"", ""you ain't shit""
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this...
""You ain't shit""

Guess she don't want me to hit her up no more
Guess she don't want me to beat it down no more
Maybe she's right and she's right, there's plenty girls I can call
Boy ain't you tired of this life, don't you ever get bored?
Guess I got used to hearing whatever I wanted to hear
Guess I got used to feeling, like you supposed to give it here
She said she thought I was different, but now she could see it clear

Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon say nothing, but this...
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me
Looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""you ain't shit""
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon say nothing, but this...
""You ain't shit""

Half the man that you think you are, no you ain't
Nothing like all the songs you sing, I hope you change
No better than my ex, other than the sex that I'm never will forget but it's on to the next
And I know you gonna regret when I'm gone, nigga yes
You ain't even took me shopping yet
Hold up, you saying I ain't shit?
Would you even be here with me here, yeah, if I wasn't rich?
We can talk about your ex cause you were cheating on him with me
And we can talk about the sex cause that's all it'll ever be
And you know that I ain't talk girl, on you
You're not a good girl, but you try hard to be

Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this...
""You ain't shit"", ""you ain't shit"", ""you ain't shit""
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this...
""You ain't shit""

That's how you feel?
That's how you feel?
Damn, no it's cool, you know... It's too late for all this bullshit
You come here and you know what time it is and now you get all emotional
Now you know you've been drinking, what are you thinking?
Hey don't you hop behind that wheel girl, not tonight
You shouldn't drive, you drunk
I won't tell no lies, girl you hurt my pride
Girl you gotta give me them keys, come back inside
It ain't even that deep, why you tripping on me?
We can take it back a couple of weeks, you was just a homie
What's your problem? I check up, I check up, I check up on you like a doctor
We roll up, we smoke up, we roll up, we smoke up like rastas
And I keep you buzzing, you bussin, you bussin like doctor
You switching it up, came here to fuck, tell me now who's the imposter?
I see how your feelings got involved
Forgot that I was supposed to run when you called
Lay down on the bed and take it off
I break you off, problem solved
Do it quick, baby strip
I get you wet as you can get, I make it drip
Won't you gon show me who's it is?
Won't you gon show me you the shit?
Crawled up in it, I'm all up in it
When I fall up in it now I got you screaming you the shit
I'm a beast, I'm a freak, she was mad at a nigga
Now she glad that a nigga got her legs in the air like this
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit"

1659,India.Arie,Ready For Love,"I am ready for love
Why are you hiding from me
I'd quickly give my freedom
To be held in your captivity

I am ready for love
All of the joy and the pain
And all the time that it takes
Just to stay in your good grace
Lately I've been thinking
Maybe you're not ready for me
Maybe you think I need to learn maturity
They say watch what you ask for 
Cause you might receive 
But if you ask me tomorrow 
I'll say the same thing

I am ready for love
Would you please lend me your ear?
I promise I won't complain 
I just need you to acknowledge I am here

If you give me half a chance
I'll prove this to you 
I will be patient, kind, faithful and true
To a man who loves music
A man who loves art
Respect's the spirit world
And thinks with his heart

I am ready for love
If you'll take me in your hands
I will learn what you teach
And do the best that I can

I am ready for love
Here with a offering of 
My voice
My Eyes
My soul
My mind

Tell me what is enough
To prove I am ready for love

I am ready"

Artist:India.Arie
C.D.:""Voyage To India""


Spoken : Let me tell you why I love him

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie


I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even, things I don't like about him are fine with me
'Cause it's not hard for me to understand him 'cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
The air he breathes

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection if him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie (no)


How can the same man that makes me so mad
Do you know what he did-(Spoken)
Turn right around and kiss me so soft
Girl do you know what he did-(Spoken)
If he ever left me I wouldn't even be sad no
Cause there's a blessin' in every lesson
And I'm glad that I knew him at all

Chrous:
'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly because
His light it shines so bright


Bridge, Break-down, & Ending:
I love the way he speaks
I love the way he thinks
I love the way that he treats his mama
I love that gap in between his teeth
I love him in every way that a woman can love a man
From personal to universal but most of all
It's unconditional

You know what I'm talking about-(Spoken)
That's the way I feel
And I always will-(Spoken)

There ain't no substitute for the truth
Either it is or isn't
('Cause he is the truth)
You see the truth it needs no proof
Either it is or it isn't
('Cause he is the truth)
Now you know the truth by the way it feels
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly
Because he is, yes he is
I wonder does he know -Echoes"
1661,Keyshia Cole,Love,"I used to think that I wasn't fun enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games, what's this all about
And I can't believe,
You're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her
You ain't see in me
But I guess it was all just make-believe

Oh, Love
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...
Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do
I'm so empty
My heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you...
My rainy days fade away, when you
Come around please tell me baby
Why you go so far away
Why you go...

Love...
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...
Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...

I found you
Yeah

Now you go, what am I gonna do
I'm so empty
My heart, my soul can't go on
Go on baby without you...
Rainy days fade away
When you come around
Say your here to stay
With me boy
I don't want you to leave me
I need you...

Callin my phone she so outta pocket

Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture
My pictures in his wallet
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam now he wanna come home
But I
Don't trust him
Though I still love him
No longer want him
Lookin' at his cousin
Kinda buzzin
Loose off the goose
Got him on a chase like cranberry juice
When he's wit you he's wishin it was me
You might be where he's at but I'm where
He wanna be (Baby Baby!)

1663,Keyshia Cole,I Remember,"Oh...
Remember...
Oh, I remember...
I wanna know...

Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you.
Thinking of all the times we shared.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
I'm sad and lonely.

No one knew all the pain I went through.
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.
But you made me leave.
And plus my heart, it just, it kept telling me so.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
So sad and lonely.

There was nowhere else to go, oh.
Nobody else to turn to, no.
For the rest of my life
I promised myself, I will love me first genuinely.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
Sad and lonely.

I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
So sad and lonely, hey.
I remember when I stormed out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
I was sad and lonely."

And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad (Treat me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had (All you had)
And though my heart is beatin' for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way
And still I stay

(Ohh)
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies (Ladies)
Feel me, come on, sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to 'preciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Lookin' out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
There's somethin' always hold me back"
1665,Sisqo,Incomplete,"Whoo
Ooh
Oh yeah yeah
Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune, still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

So, I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Said without you girl, ahh listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter summer spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin', ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
That without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything
To hear you say that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (all the women)
All the expensive cars (all the money)
All of the money don't amount to you (you can have it all)

I can make believe I have everything (just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete (alright, alright, alight, alright)

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (I don't have you)
All the expensive cars (I don't have you)
All of the money don't amount to you (it makes me wanna cry)

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete

Without ya girl
Without ya girl my life
Without you girl
My life my life is incomplete
Without you girl
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah yeah
Whoo"
1666,The Weeknd,The Morning,"I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
Listen, listen

From the morning to the evening, complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen if a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight, got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping, yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic, get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Push it to the limit, push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money, a virgin to the fame
So this my only chance and when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom, closer to the top
The higher that I climb, the harder I'mma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit, watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion, why these niggas testing?
Always fucking twisted, why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance, get shit popping
Zombies of the night, niggas ain't talking
If they hyping to the crew get it in like pockets
Downtown loving, when the moon coming
Only place to find baseheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Better slow down, she'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding, man, her love is too damn foreign

Look at all that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work"

Drawing me in and you kicking me out?
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down

What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm outta my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll gives my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood

You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing
This ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you

Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

1672,Shontelle,Impossible - Main,"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)

And know when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)

Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love

And I emptied out my cards to her
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain

Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank

Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the devil

Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby
So put down your perfume

1675,Lil Wayne,How To Love,"Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

Ooh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love"
1676,R. Kelly,I Believe I Can Fly,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an distrustful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, 'cause I believe in you
Oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)

1677,Drake;Rihanna,Take Care,"(Rihanna)
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

(Drake)
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change it, I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show

When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

(Rihanna)
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost

(Drake)
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends, when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do

One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

(Rihanna)
I know you've been hurt
By someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost"

Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' it 'round and around

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me, you just don't realize
You've never been there before, it's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more

You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out and cheat at night, just like you did baby
But that's alright, (Huh) I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you just come back to me

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Woah, why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you would be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you would be mine, woah
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you'd still be mine

I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands

(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall

It gets hard for you to listen
To the things that imma say to make you mine

It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break and end up like before

I swear I- Always- Fall- for your type (yeah)

For your type
Tell me why I- Always- Fall- for your type
For your type

Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you movin away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just saying sh-t
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen,
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it and I fall

I swear I- Always- Fall- for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I- Always- Fall- for your type
For your type
(I just can't explain this sh-t at all)
Fall- For your type
(I just can't explain this sh-t at all)
Fall- For your type

1683,Mariah Carey,We Belong Together,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sittin' here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything, I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling, now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here 'cause, baby
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio, singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now.""
Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station 
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better

Sometimes...
You have to get yourself first
I'm doin' me...

Sometimes as a women we do more than we should
To a man
That just don't treat us good, no
Gave him my heart, my time
Did all that I could
In the past
To keep him here with me, yeah
But now I woke, opened both my eyes up
Realize that I don't need any other
Man, if you can't love me equally
Then you don't need to be with me
Nothin' more beautiful then knowin' your worth
And finally,
I know exactly what I deserve

I'm doin' me, this time around
Doin' me, don't need you now
I rather be by myself
I won't let your drama hold me down
I'm doin' me, this time around
Doin' me, 'cause I finally found
I rather be by myself
I'm doin' me, yeah

Won't spend another minute wastin my time
On a man
That only tells me lies
Ain't sayin' no no no no no
That I don't need love
But them games
I don't need that in my life, no

Now, I could pray for you to act right everyday
But it ain't up to me to make you change
Life is to damn short to live unhappily
So I'm bein selfish and
Puttin' myself in first place

I'm doin' ne
This time around
I'm doin' me
This time around
No more cryin, going through hell
It's so good, I'm lovin' myself

By Anthony Hamilton
Charlene
Anthony Hamilton

Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
To hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold

She must have told me a thousand times or more
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

She knows I really love this old music thang
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things

But I forgot about loving her
Forget the money, diamonds and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

Oh oh oh
Sometimes I cry
Charlene if you're listening would you call on me
Because my heart is aching"
1689,Gerald Levert,Thinkin' Bout It,"Girl I been waitin' on this day
Bet you thought you never hear me say
You been creeping around all over town
Been laying it down been messin' around
What goes around always comes around
Baby girl I thought we was down
Girl I hope you change your freaky ways
'Cause I really wanna stay
Tell me is he the best since I been there
That I should share your underwear
Do you really think he cares

All this time I've been sleeping with you
You been sleeping with me
You been stroking him and loving him
And kissing him and hugging him
Oh why you've been creeping with him
He's been sexing your friends
Not I got you thinking about it
Thinking about it thinking about it
Thinking about it

Girl I think that I should let you know
That I'm gonna have to up and go
If you keep giving it up cutting up
And acting fast giving up the ass
I love you but I had enough
Do it again it's gonna be your last
I can forgive but won't forget the
Things you did
You'll soon regret ever dissin' me
'Cause this could be the end of we
Can't you see
Girl you're hurting me

Repeat Chorus three times

For the life of me I just can't conceive
Why I just can't leave you
Why you do this to me baby
I feel like a fool
But what can I do your love gots me weak baby
Why must I endure your constant greed
Your endles need to be so damn freaky
Now I understand 'cause it wasn't for me
Yes pay backs a mother baby

Oh why tell me why whey are you so freaky
Tell me why, why are you so freaky

So beautiful, just can't be more beautiful.
You're so beautiful, you just can't be more beautiful.
(Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, beautiful. Whoa, whoa, whoa)

When I look into your eyes, it's like staring at the stars in the night.
It's like learning every reason why you're my earth, my sun, the center of my life.
If your name is love, then I know there's a god above.
Who wants me just the way I am and that's enough.
To believe and be the only one I trust, now that's love.

When the storm gets rough she, calms the rain.
When time gets tough she, don't complain.
When it's hard to breathe, she breathes for me.
Baby you're all I need.

Through the heartache and pain, it's your love that remains.
Girl this rose says one thing, it's your beautiful, you're beautiful.
All the hell you've been through, I don't know how you do it.
Wishing I was more like you, 'cause you're beautiful, you're beautiful.

I'm living in a dream, it's like a fortune I knew this is supposed to be.
You're like the land when I'm far out in the sea.
Just like a sinner who's life has been redeemed.
That's how you change me.

When the storm gets rough you, calm the rain.

When time gets tough you, ease the pain.
When it's hard to breathe, you breathe for me.
Baby, you're all I need.

Through the heartache and pain, it's your love that remains.

Sunshine,
From the first time that we met
Helpless,
You took my heart I must confess
Deep in your eyes,
There seemed to be a look that said
Hello, is it me you're searching for

Suddenly my sunshine turn to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
You didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans
And it hurts so bad
Someone tell me...

Why are all the good girls, taken every time
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says Hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
Taken every time...
Taken every time...

Dancing,
With your body close to mine
(Then you kiss my lips girl)
Girl I thought it was a sign
I want you forever
But good intentions never win
I've got that feeling
Tonight I'll be alone again

Suddenly my sunshine turned to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
You didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans
And it hurts so bad
Someone tell me

Why are all the good girls, taken every time
And why do I keep falling for

I hold my head up high to ease the pain
But quite frankly lord,
I don't know how much more this world can take
Yes we truly need more love for each other.

1735,Raheem DeVaughn,Complicated,"Bliss, magnificent, orgasmic,
Love can be all these things!
Fear, timeless, complicated

They say that we make a good couple
But I'm too afraid to mess up what'special
We do what lovers do, we are not obligated that's what makes it cool
How we know it's true.
All the way she can tell from the surface
I won't never hurt them on purpose
'Cause she don't deserve it, and I think she's perfect
But there's a chance things will change if she knows this, oh

I'm kinda single, but I'm in love
It's complicated because, because
(Lately don't mind)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah

Our friendship's too good,
To damage it if we advanced it
I don't think we can handle it!
And that's how I feel! I could be wrong
But me speaking from experience, I know
Sometimes I get confused, trying to handle it
Going through emotion, when I'm not emotionless
I'd rather be here for her to lean on
Then to be mad at me, 'cause I let this go
It's complicated!

I'm kinda single, but I'm in love
It's complicated because, because
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it (the situation is this complicated cause)
It's complicated, so complicated (oh, like a puzzle, baby)
I can't explain it but I'm being patient
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah!

So cold, can't change
This friendship, our bonds will remain
Call it what you want, but I know what it is
Com-Pli-Cated
My Best friend my buddy, I trust in her only
Has good intentions for me!
Call what you want, but I know what it is

Never said that satisfying the masses was how I would live my life
And never once did I say all of my decisions would be right
I never said I would ignore my heart and listen with just my mind
Ooh and I know it looks like I've gone crazy
But in the way of love and what it does, I'll be crazy for us

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me that loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don't mind, no I don't mind
Forget the rules I'm over the game
Baby if loving the way you do is ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous, call me ridiculous

Every one knows what I'm s'posed to do,
Every body says I'm out my mind to feel what I feel for you (feel what I feel for you)
Every body needs to mind their own...
To this love I'm not brand new
See I know when it's real love
Though they think I don't have a clue
I do
And I know it looks like I've gone crazy
But in the way of love and what it does, I'll be crazy for us

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me the loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don't mind, no I don't mind
Forget the rules I'm over the game
Baby if loving the way you do it's ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous, call me ridiculous

For seeing something inside you that no one else can see
That's way they don't understand me, no
So stupid, idiot, blind to it
Say what they will
Baby that's what I will
Long as it's always real
Ridiculous that's me

The smell of a fragrance
Or the taste of sweet kiss
The passion, the thrill
Goose bumps and the chills
Thy wish is thy will

See I love how the way he made you

1742,Kenny Lattimore,For You,"For you I give a lifetime of stability, anything you want of me, nothing is
Impossible
For you there are no words or ways to show my love or all the thoughts
I'm thinking of
'Cause this life is no good alone since we've become one I've made a
Change
Everything I do now makes sense, all roads end, all I do is for you

For you I share the cup of love that overflows and anyone who knows us
Knows that I would change all faults I have
For you there is no low or high or in between of my heart that you
Haven't seen
'Cause I share all I have and am, nothing I've said is hard to understand
All I feel I feel deeper still and always will all this love is for you

Every note that I play, every word I might say, every melody I feel
Are only for you and your appeal
Every page that I write, everyday of my life would not be filled without
The things
That my love for you now brings

For you I'd make a promise of fidelity, now and for eternity
No one could replace this vow
For you I'd take your hand and heart and everything and add to them a
Wedding ring
'Cause this life is no good alone, since we've become one you're all I know
If this feeling should leave I'd die and here's why
All I am is for you

Everything I do now makes sense, all roads end, all I do...
Is for you
Only for you"

I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

Girl when we first started we were spending all our time together in love
Now we're growning on and you're afraid of losing me, don't be
I've got a heart full of love even though I might not show it
Girl it's you I dream of and just so you know it
You have my attention, anything you need at all
I'll be there when you call me

I've got things on my mind, takin' my time, but I'm...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone, just pick up the phone, 'cause I...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

We used to dream that one day we'd have everything we want
But now that things are movin', I hope that we don't move apart
You still have my heart
I've got so much to do, but girl it doesn't matter
But when it comes down to you I can't think of nothing better
Every time I'm stressin', I find that it's a blessin' to
To be hearin' from you

I've got things on my mind, takin' my time, but I'm...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

A pretty girl who makes my life complete
Ever since the day I found her
She's all that I dream
No other so lovely
I've never seen such a face
There are no words that can explain
The feeling she gives me
And every time that she smiles
And I look in her eyes

1 - I fell in love with a beautiful girl
There's no one that compares to her


Never thought I'd be so lucky
Beautiful girl, beautiful
I wanna make her mine forever

I've been far from perfect
She's had plenty reason to leave, ooh
But somehow she forgives me

From the life I used to lead
I never imagined I could be the one to perceive
Someone as beautiful as she
And every moment that I live and I breathe
She makes my life so sweet"

Oh oh, oh yeah

All alone by the phone
Waiting on you to call on a busy weekend
Tell me have I seen when I stayed around
Around the town waiting on you to tell me what to do
'Cause I'm happy being with you

Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
Day and night I just can't get enough
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
And I'll be giving you all of my love

It's just a wish on my mind
Hoping you'd have the time
When I wanna see you
For something to hold on to
If love is just a silly game
Then I'm a fool that sang for loving you
Still I feel you don't have nothing to prove

Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
Day and night I just can't get enough
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
And I'll be giving you all of my love

Maybe on tomorrow
I can show you years tomorrow
If you let me, baby we'll see
And we can get together
We can try to blend forever holding tightly
Then baby we can do what we want to

Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
Day and night I just can't get enough
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
And I'll be giving you all of my love

Touching you, holding you

Last night I think I fell in love with you
It was from a window watching you around my way

So I wrote some words that made it easier to say
Lady would you lay

Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely

1748,Dave Hollister,One Woman Man,"All right, (hmm)
It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
'Cause everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Ooh, and now
(See now that I found the love of my life)
(I don't have to trick no more)
Girl, it was nice seein' you
But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Know what I'm saying
'Cause if you don't take care of home
Somebody else will, ya feel me?
Y'all know what I'm talking 'bout
Check it

If she thinks you don't say it enough
Tell her you love her
Every time that your baby
Comes across your mind, heh yeah heh
And if you think your girl wants the world
Just give it to her
Be the sunshine that brightens up her life
Don't let her get away, no

1 - Don't let her get away
If you really care enough
Love her everyday
Over and over and over

2 - If you take care of home
You don't have to worry your girl
Take care of home
Take care of home
Maybe if you keep her first
You don't have to worry your girl
Take care of home
Take care of home

Hold her hand when you walk through the mall
Cause you know she likes it
Do all the little things you used to do, hmm mmm
Day and night make sure you live to keep her happy
Make her realize how beautiful she is
She's so beautiful
Don't let her, no...

You got a queen
So take care of her in every way

You know that she adores you
So worship the ground she walks on

It's not all it's cracked up to be.
It turned into screaming days and solo nights.
Just wasn't right (yeah...)
I didn't really wanna see you,
Was happy when you were leaving yeah...
I liked how it felt when I was by myself.
And that's the way I wanna be,

Just let it be.
Just let it be...

I gotta go. I gotta leave.
So please don't make it hard for me.

I gotta let it go... (2x)

Couldn't have given you more,
Gave you everything.
There wasn't anything that you were denied (yeah).
But you should never give it all...
'Cause sometimes there's nothing left
But bitterness and regret,
And it just ain't worth it.

'Cause then there's the sudden change
Out of nowhere, it seems.
Never know I could be so mean,
But that's just how far you pushed me (yeah).

You say it just isn't fair
And you didn't know.
You need to take responsibility for your own,
'Cause you're grown.
And you known (yeah)

I gotta go. I gotta leave.
So please don't make it hard for me.
I've gave enough, I'm tired of love,
I gotta let it go... (2x)

Now I take the blame
For trying to stay and work it out.
Shoulda left before it got complicated,
Shoulda left when there was still some happiness.

Yes I take the blame
For having faith in the relationship.
I thought it made me complete,
But the truth is,
I'm complete without it.

Yeah-eah
(Gotta Let Go-ooh-ooh-ooh)

I gotta go. I gotta leave.
So please don't make it hard for me.
I've gave enough, I'm tired of love,
I gotta let it go... (2x)"

1752,Kindred The Family Soul,Stars,"So many times you could have walked away
But I didn't have to say a word to convince you to stay
'Cause you know it and I know this thing is real
So we continue to learn and our love grows deeper still

Each day I watch you get better at this
Each moment I'm more and more convinced
We trust in love, we took the risk
We ran our own pace, we won our race
And I could never turn away

We've come so far
Stars look up at you, baby
My heart belongs
Right here next to you, baby

If I had just one wish it would be to stay together
Stay together, let's grow together
It's not much to ask of us, I know we can do it
I always knew it

Always look at me the way you do today
Treat me like a friend, listen to what I say
'Cause, girl, I'm with you, with you all the way
And I would never turn away

We've come so far
Stars look up at you, baby
My heart belongs

Right here next to you, baby

We've come so far
Stars look up at you, baby
My heart belongs
Right here next to you, baby

Always comfort me the same way you do today
Treat me like a friend, listen to what I say, say
Oh yeah, I could never turn away, no

We've come so far

My heart belongs
Right here next to you, baby

Nothing compares to candlelight and you.

Lady, there's no way to deny, that you keep love new,
So I'll give you what you desire, I found what I need in you,
You can believe in me, and I won't let you down, I'll be here,
And I want you to know that I love you,
Like no other man could ever, ever do,
And I'll keep holding on for candlelight and you.

And if I had to live my life all over again,
What I would do, is be with you (you baby).

It made us believe it there was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside

1759,The Weeknd,Professional,"It's ideal
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town

You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
All this time this ain't you
Da da da da
I decide when we're through

I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I love, you love
We're sophisticated
At lovin'...

What does it mean
When your heart's already numb
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, this is just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's supposed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you've put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah

I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I love, you love
We're sophisticated
At lovin'...

All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Ooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no
Every touch that you sell is a lie

I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I love, you love
We're sophisticated

And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne

I haven't been around the town in a long while
I apologize but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely on me
I remember on the bathroom floor
Before I went on tour
When you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, ooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And oh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I would

Honey please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled bind, unrestrainted touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now, I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in

Talking to myself but I never listen,
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been

Making all the same mistakes

Now more and more I wonder where you are

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you

Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice driving me insane
How I wish that you would call, to say

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you

I miss you.
I miss you.
No more lonliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
No more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me, come back to me
Oh oh oh

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you.

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you."
1772,Brian McKnight,Back At One,"It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The places you need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real

If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeaheah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one, yeaheaheah

So incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far

'Cause you know that you got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just till the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one"
1773,Aaliyah,At Your Best (You Are Love),"Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know
Let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know...

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began

But if you feel, boy, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know...

Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world (Look beyond your world)
Try and find a place for me (Try and find, find a place for me)
Cause...

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know...

Let me know, let me know, let me know
Ah, ah, ah - ha
See, stay at your best, baby"

1775,Shanice,When I Close My Eyes,"Darlin', here we are again
Right about now
There is a need to tell you what I'm feelin'
I'm so grateful 
To have a man like you who knows what to do
Makes me feel like a woman should, oh, yeah

1 - When I close my eyes
I break down and cry
It's somethin' 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me

Never thought that I would find
So much peace of mind
And every moment that I share with you
Sometimes I don't know why
We fell so deep in love
But then it all comes back to me because...

Repeat 1

When I'm with you 
I feel so good
No one loves me like you

When I close my eyes

Repeat 1 (3x)"

If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember to tell me
All the things you forgot

If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only your best friend can
Only your best friend can

If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you
I mean help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless but sometimes
Sometimes those are the things
That being in love's about
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you do to me
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time after time I try to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In your condition I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, oh

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain

I get so weak
Something 'bout the way ya do the things you do it
Knocks me right off of my feet, oh
I can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet

To let you know just where I'm coming from.
But you will see
It's just a matter of time
My love surely make you mine

Well, I'm
Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone Seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong, it's all right, my man

His love will send me on and on
With my man
People out there can you understand

I'm givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

So much joy for us it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?

And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true.
You tell me 'what does it mean'.

Baby, I'm thinking of you
Trying to be more of a man for you
And I don't have much riches
But we gonna see it through
'Cause I love you

Ho... ho... ho...

Some men need lots of women
For their passions to feel
But I want only you, girl

Hmm, hmm
Hmm... hmm... mmm...
You know
One time things got so bad until
I had to go to one of my friends and talk to him
And I told him, I said, You know
I'm having problems with the woman that I love
It seems that I call her on the phone and I just can't get her to answer
And then I went to her house and I saw a car parked in the driveway
I knocked on the door, but still my knocks went unanswered
And then I went home and I-I watched television until television went off
And then I played my records until I just didn't want to hear them anymore
And finally I went to bed, but I found myself waking up a few hours later
And the tears were running down my face
And my friend told me, he said, Lenny,
You just oughta forget about her
But I told my friend, I said, You know
Maybe you've never been in love like I've been in love
And maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt
But this is what I told my friend
I said, You know, sometimes you get lonely
You get lonely, you get lonely
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I cry, I cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And the tears would fill up in the wells
In the wells of my eyes, aww baby
And then it got so bad, it got so bad
Till one time I thought I'd roll myself up in a big ol' ball and die
And then I met you, darlin'
And you smiled at me
Oh, oh, it was such a pretty smile, yes, it was
And you reached out your hand
You helped me (Helped), you helped me (Helped me), you helped, oh
I'm glad, baby, I'm glad, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby, ey, ey, ey
I won't ever leave you, baby
I won't ever grieve you, baby
I'm gonna love you, oh, oh, oh, baby
I'm glad, I'm glad, baby
Oh, oh, yeah, baby, oh, oh, oh

1798,Mint Condition,What Kind Of Man Would I Be,"What Kind Of Man Would I Be

You say you feel disenchanted

'Cause lately he takes you for granted

Still faithful and true you remained

And to her so divine

You pour out your heart and I listen

And we catch a vibe reminiscing

Temptation so strong not to mention

The yearning inside

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same

'Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie

'Cause if we lay down tonight

It won't justify throwing love aside

This feeling is strong and we know it

But we gotta see past the moment

There's too much to lose if we flow it

This is no lie

But still here we are altogether

With promises made that we never

You're feeling it now more than ever

I can't deny

Here we are
All alone
But somehow we got to remain strong

Makes me wanna say oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Just gotta say oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Been feelin' you all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married

Meet me at the alter in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger (so) we might as well do it
Been feelin' you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married

Said I done it all, but frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
Cause making love to just anyone ain't happinin'
I just gotta be with you.ooh osh
Did you think about, us finishing something we started so long ago
I wanna give you my aauhall (all)
Did you think about maybe us havin' some babies
Come on wont you be my lady
Forever girllllllllllll

And I just can't wait for that night
'Cause I need you here with me and lets start a family"

Like an angel spreading her wings, oh, have mercy
Anticipating my whole life to wake up, show you the sunrise
Shine down on you and me

See you in the morning
Look at you, layin' there
Finally got you in my bed
Only thought goin' through my head

See you in the morning
Sorry, I can't help but stare
Soon as you turnin' over
I'm gonna hold you closer

In the morning, good morning
Under the cover
In the morning, good morning
Under the cover

Excuse me for speaking while I'm sleeping
Baby, I'm dreaming about you grinding on me

And right before the early rise, I start the countdown
The bird sings, 'bout to go down, hello, you're up under me
And I don't want no breakfast baby, you're everything that I need
Tryin' to get you in my t-shirt before you go to work

See you in the morning
Look at you, lyin' there
Finally got you in my bed
Only thought goin' through my head

See you in the morning
Sorry, I can't help but stare

I sacrifice for you, girl
I'm stuck on pleasing you
It's the best part of the day
To leave a smile up on your face

So see you in the morning
Look at you, layin' there
Finally got you in my bed
Only thought goin' through my head

See you in the morning, oh girl

Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous, and entitled
But they swearing on the Bible that they love you

They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world 'cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

1834,Trey Songz,Heart Attack,"We share, somethin' so charming, still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls

Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack

It's killing me, swear I never cried so much,
'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time, that I frowned the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down

Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts, 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to

That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had"

Never knew how to love a man
She's addicted to breaking hearts and moving on

Blinded by an angel's face
It's the sweetest poison in one kiss
And now you gotta ventil be your face
But even everything you lips say

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

Got you walking through a maze, yeah
Eyes closed tryin' to find your way
Got your mom's respond
Hoping she gon' make a sound
But she don't wanna be found
'Cause she'll tell you come anyway
And you know the difference
From a real lot of fake
Devil in the trust, but an angel in the face
Never ever yours but it's only for the day
Is it real when you calling my name

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

Wanted to get a benefit out about
The best in how I wanna help you bring you home
I know something's missing inside
If you let me I can so improve
Girl it ain't no running from the truth
She says I'll be there
Girl don't just tell me what I wanna hear

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside

Pretty girls lie

That's a pretty face and
She did find a way
That's a beautiful girl
Lost in the world

Could've been making love and end up in a fight
Don't tell me why

1840,Trey Songz,Without A Woman,"Picture this coming home from a long day's work, no food is left
Picture this steady trying to show the world of your worth, and nobody cares
Picture this no kissing, ain't no touching, there's no hugging
And in the evening no good loving

Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same
I'm telling you a boy can't be a man without a woman
And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold 
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 

What if you had no hands to rub upon your shoulders
And in the morning she's not there to fix your rogers
You're sick as a dog right now
Kids running all around that house
No one to help you out
Picture this you pen these bills all 'bout yourself
No one to tell you watch you health
But keep it girl, you might as well
Picture this 'cause your world don't spin without her
And hers won't spin without you 

Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same
I'm telling you a boy can't be a man without a woman
And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold 
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 

Say hello to pain, goodbye to love
Hello to rain the sun will never shine again
There'll be no Wednesday all nights
No make-ups after fights 
Girl I'll make it right
I'm lonely with my pillow
Your car's not in the drive way
Clothes ain't in the closet
Girl I'm broken hearted 
Come and find me 'cause I'm lost without my woman
And I know that a man can't be a man without a woman
You can try hard as you can 
But you won't be nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold 
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 

See that life ain't life
And living ain't living
Without my woman
Hurting inside
Without my woman no, no, no"

When you and I would take the world on
Yeah, to the place where no one knows of

I'm a ghost looking for you
It hurts but it's true 

That I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again 
In my arms, never ever again,
And I will never ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl never ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

Now you are long gone
But I still got your birthday card
Yeah, put a stamp on her address
Oh now I can't stop dreaming 'bout you
I'm a lost star without you
It hurts but it's true

That I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again 
In my arms, never ever again,
And I will never ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl never ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

Suddenly it takes me all along
To the point where it breaks my heart
Such a major love, never gonna touch again

I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again 
In my arms, never ever again,
I wish we had a little more to look in love
Never ever again
Never ever again
Never again"

Make me wonder how you taste.

Maybe 'cause the thugs say that I'm cool.
Maybe 'cause the girls wanna be like you.
Maybe it's the ice that made you look twice.
Maybe it's your back that made me look back.

Or maybe my physique and my upcoming from the streets.
It keeps you runnin' back and got you cummin in the sheets.
From the first time I met you, you've become a lil freak.

Every time she leaves it's my heart that she's taken from me
I don't know if she's gone for good or returning in the morning
Cannot wait through the night 'cause I can't help the tossing and turning
I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows get lonely
On... Yo side of the bed
Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side,
Yo... On yo side of the bed (x3)
Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side (it's so lonely there)
I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here... no

I just wanna breathe your air
Watch you when your wrapping up your hair
Gazing at the mirrors up there, I'm reaching while imagining that you're here
Awake through the night 'cause I can't help the tossing and turning
I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows get lonely
On... Yo side of the bed

Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side,
Yo... On yo side of the bed
Yo side, Yo side,(where I lay my head) Yo side, Yo side, Yo side,
Yo... On yo side of the bed
Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side,
Yo... On yo side of the bed

I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here... no

Let it play baby...
So lonely there...

Do I make your body go crazy?
Or when you catch me in a magazine baby,
Do you rip me out and save my page?
If my voice comes through your speaker
And you legs suddenly get weaker
This is for you.
Yeah
I'm hopin' it's gon' get you through.
So I can get to you.
Tell me what you see
When you think of me.
I want this to be
Just like your fantasy.
Oh, girl.
Girl I'm comin' over.
Got some things to show ya.
Turn yo stereo up

Got some sex for your stereo
Girl you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it.
Now put your hands on the radio,
Don't be scared to touch it.
Imagine I was there,
Baby pulin' on your hair.
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singin' to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it.

Now can my ladies in the back make some noise?
I see you.
It don't matter where you are.
In ya crib, at ya job, or in the car.
It's for you,
This is for you.
Wherever you can stick me in (stick me in)
Just let the record spin.
Baby it's on you.
What you gonna do?
Choice is all yours:
You can put me in fast-forward
Or
We can start the record over (over)
Can you feel my words creepin' up your legs
Takin' off your clothes?

Now you need a little bass
So let me give you a taste.
I want you to feel my subwolfer
Baby when I give it to ya.
Now you need some highs
So I'ma make you touch the sky.
Ooh, girl now slide your body near,
Girl take them headphones,
Come a little closer.
So I can hear you when you moan.
Now let me just adjust your knob
Turn it till I get you hot,
Get you hot, get you hot.

Just one last time


'Cause if she catch me with you
She gon' kill us

Ain't nobody perfect
But I just can't take no more, 'cause...

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night

Hold up, baby girl
Don't talk, just listen

See the problem is I'm too deep involved
To be playin' with your emotions,
You really got me open, oh
I gotta figure it out
Can't let no pussy come before my baby
Not my baby, no
'Cause she's the only one to ease my mind
But girl you just so fine, oh!
Give it to me one last time
Baby, let your hair down
Take it to the bed now
Spread them lovely legs now
One last round

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night

My truck is parked out front, so lets ride

I can read you mind baby
And I know what your thinking
But it's all right (with me baby), it's all right (with me) baby (x2)

So baby take a ride with me
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pouring down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body, that's my goal
So baby just come and down here
Just let the gravity pull you near

I know you wanna rub
I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel
So baby keep it real

I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my b-e-d

Such a provider he cares for me
Wish I could give him all of me

Compared him to you, but he can't match your score
In this game of love, there's no rules
When it comes to us, I choose you

If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he can save the world that will never be enough
'Cause I choose you
I choose you
And if it ain't you
Then it's just not worth it

I heard you found you another
But she's not me, how could you love her?
We got history, we were meant to be
She can't replace what we had based on chemistry
I tried hating but I just love you more
Don't care what she do
She can never match my score
In this game of love, there's no rules
When it comes to us, I choose you.

If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he can save the world that will never be enough
'Cause I choose you
I choose you
And if it ain't you
Then it's just not worth it

Can't give up
I'm a keep on trying
To get your love
No sense in denying
You had my heart
I'm not over you
Whatever it takes I'm gon' do

If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he can save the world that will never be enough
'Cause I choose you
I choose you
And if it ain't you
Then it's just not worth it"
1872,Pleasure P,Under,"Callin' my river to let her know
I'ma be on my way
Missin' how the river flow even though
It's only been a couple of days

'Cause it be raining and complaining you
Got that water made for drinking up
Baby if I drown tonight it's all worth it for you
I don't need no rescue

I'ma hold my breath until you feel it in your chest
When I go under, under
I ain't coming up until you scream and knock it off
When I go under, under

You be making waves, my ship's here to stay
I got what it takes to swim up in it all day
I want you to shake it, later tell me it was great
When I go under, under

Girl relax, captain can handle that
I'ma take this cruise real slow
Heading to paradise, close your eyes
All you gotta do is let it go

The way your body flow, it's a private show
And I can't stop until it's spilling over
It's a sight to see you and it's calling me
Telling me your body's getting closer

I'ma hold my breath until you feel it in your chest
When I go under, under
I ain't coming up until you scream and knock it off
When I go under, under

You be making waves, my ship's here to stay
I got what it takes to swim up in it all day
I want you to shake it, later tell me it was great
When I go under, under

I'm jumping in, no lifesaver
Don't know when I'm coming up
Deep sea diving in your treasure
I'm giving you all this pleasure

Ooh girl, I'm so into you
So deep I don't know what to do
Just let the water flow
Till the tidal wave washes us ashore

I'ma hold my breath until you feel it in your chest
When I go under, under
I ain't coming up until you scream and knock it off
When I go under, under

You be making waves, my ship's here to stay
I got what it takes to swim up in it all day
I want you to shake it, later tell me it was great
When I go under, under

Under, under

I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shot guns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

Wale
Ay we back though
The sun's still there, look
Good morning baby, didn't mean to wake you
But the buy-in is your precious time and my temptation
Never mind that, I guess I'll climb the ladder later
'Less you try and put your back on me then I'ma take it
What is this, macchiato you tasting?
Caffeinated your body, I swear that y'all only stay up
Grab a towel, she need it, now she open again
She say my stroke is a scone, I let that soak in her bean
Wassup with it, ok what's really good (more)
I never know your bad side until you show your good
Ok what's up with it? Just let me set the mood
She said she don't on the first night, the morning wood
We talk recent movies and old tunes
Emulate 50 Shades over Jodeci grooves
But I'm joking, I'm tryna sing your body that notion
If nobody throw me a float, then I'ma drown in the ocean
Come and take this work
Fuck around and be late to work
As the conversation fades let's play ""you hang up first""
With your silly self, pictures in my celly, well
Kisses give her goosebumps, well that's cool I used to tutor braille
'Sup baby, ain't mean to wake you
I can put you back to sleep if that's a consolation
And I'm tired of waiting, so no more disappointment
I'm not your regular Joe, I'll be your coffee in the morning

Miguel
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

Wordplay, turns in to gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
Pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into fucking in the morning

Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

Coffee in the morning

I've never felt comfortable like this

Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under bright peach skies watching the sunrise
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
And two lost angels discover salvation

Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye"

Ride it, my pony

Come and jump on it
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Sitting here flossing
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony

Come and jump on it
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

First we'll show and tell
Till I reach your pony tail
Oh

Lurk all over and through you baby
Until we reach the stream
You'll be on my jockey team

It's killing me, swear I never cried so much,

Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time, that I frowned the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'

Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

1900,Trey Songz,Pretty Girl's Lie,"She grew up without a father
Never knew how to love a man
She's addicted to breaking hearts and moving on
So I never really stood a chance
And a sparkle lid your eyes
They shine so flawless I'm amazed
Blinded by an angel's face
It's the sweetest poison in one kiss
And now you gotta ventil be your face
But even everything you lips say

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie
Pretty girls lie

Got you walking through a maze, yeah
Eyes closed tryin' to find your way
Got your mom's respond
Hoping she gon' make a sound
But she don't wanna be found
'Cause she'll tell you come anyway
And you know the difference
From a real lot of fake
Devil in the trust, but an angel in the face
Never ever yours but it's only for the day
Is it real when you calling my name

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

Wanted to get a benefit out about
The best in how I wanna help you bring you home
I know something's missing inside
If you let me I can so improve
Girl it ain't no running from the truth
She says I'll be there
Girl don't just tell me what I wanna hear

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

That's a pretty face and
She did find a way
That's a beautiful girl
Lost in the world
Can't trust what she says
After so many break-ups and make-ups in life
Could've been making love and end up in a fight
Don't tell me why
Pretty girls lie"

1903,Trey Songz,Fumble,"We were so dumb in love
Couldn't get enough, no
But I could've loved you so much better
And I can't believe you never walked out
And it's not your fault

That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

Girl you used to feel so bound in my arms
I wish we could touch some more (and it's eating me alive)
I'm sitting, working on this letter (and I prove myself it's done)
The first line I write, I was wrong
So wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
And it's not your fault
It's so wrong, it's so wrong, it's so wrong

That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you too
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

It's all or nothing
Give you my all or nothing
Want all of you or nothing
I'm sorry that I messed up girl
I really love you, really really love you
Now that I know I love you
I'll never love another girl
And it's not your fault

That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
I should've let go
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you too
Whatever I asked you to, I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart

Ever since the day we met
And her mama said the same
I dropped the ball I'm so ashamed
I'm bad news, real bad news, I fumbled your heart"
1904,Trey Songz,Without A Woman,"Picture this coming home from a long day's work, no food is left
Picture this steady trying to show the world of your worth, and nobody cares
Picture this no kissing, ain't no touching, there's no hugging
And in the evening no good loving

Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same
I'm telling you a boy can't be a man without a woman
And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold 
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 

What if you had no hands to rub upon your shoulders
And in the morning she's not there to fix your rogers
You're sick as a dog right now
Kids running all around that house
No one to help you out
Picture this you pen these bills all 'bout yourself
No one to tell you watch you health
But keep it girl, you might as well
Picture this 'cause your world don't spin without her
And hers won't spin without you 

Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same
I'm telling you a boy can't be a man without a woman
And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold 
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 

Say hello to pain, goodbye to love
Hello to rain the sun will never shine again
There'll be no Wednesday all nights
No make-ups after fights 
Girl I'll make it right
I'm lonely with my pillow
Your car's not in the drive way
Clothes ain't in the closet
Girl I'm broken hearted 
Come and find me 'cause I'm lost without my woman
And I know that a man can't be a man without a woman
You can try hard as you can 
But you won't be nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold 
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 

See that life ain't life
And living ain't living
Without my woman
Hurting inside
Without my woman no, no, no"
1905,Trey Songz,Interlude4U,"Girl, this is for you
Only for you
I'll be going nowhere

Just me, love you
Go again
I got you baby, I got you
You ain't never gon find another man

Want to take your love"
1906,Trey Songz,Simply Amazing,"I can't really explain what it is she does
But um, whatever it is
It's um, simply, simply amazing

Her head is on my chest, sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way, you are (you are)

See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned, if I don't believe in us
And how we play a fight up in the bathroom
Next thing I know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

She ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe, for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are),
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing, amaze-amazing

The girl's a work of art, and I can't help but stare
With a smile like the sunset, and the ocean is her hair
Ooh what she do ain't fair ooh
She know me better, than I know myself, mhmmm

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
Like when I said I loved you for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change

'Cause she ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me

There is nothing, in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody who could ever compare to you
Ooh

She ain't perfect (no she ain't), but she's worth it (she is)
Every breath I breathe, for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing"
1907,Trey Songz,Never Again,"When the days are done 
When you and I would take the world on
Yeah, to the place where no one knows of
Now I can't stop thinking about you
I'm a ghost looking for you
It hurts but it's true 

That I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again 
In my arms, never ever again,
And I will never ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl never ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

Now you are long gone
But I still got your birthday card
Yeah, put a stamp on her address
Oh now I can't stop dreaming 'bout you
I'm a lost star without you
It hurts but it's true

That I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again 
In my arms, never ever again,
And I will never ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl never ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

Suddenly it takes me all along
To the point where it breaks my heart
Such a major love, never gonna touch again

I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again 
In my arms, never ever again,
I wish we had a little more to look in love
Never ever again
Never ever again
Never again"
1908,Ray J,One Wish,"Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"

1928,Jon B.,They Don't Know,"Heard about my past
Things I used to do
The games I used to play
The girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind
You think I'm doin' wrong
Can I say what is real
You are the only one
When I'm not around
Do you think I'm me
Or what the jealous ones
Are claimin me to be
You should know by now
That it's gonna take
Alot of trust from you
For us to make it through

You should know baby
You're my angel
Nothins gonna make you fall from heaven
Girl I just wanna love you

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about
'Bout you and me
Put it out your mind
'Cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here (2x)

Girl let's talk about
What your friends told you
That I'm a selfish man
Want my cake and eat it too
Maybe in my past
But you've changed me now
Now that I've learned to love
It's you that showed me how
You're love's so real
I'd be a fool to play
To play around on you
I hope to stay with you
You should know by now
That it's gonna take
Alot of trust from you

1929,Jon B.,Are U Still Down?,"Jon b (tupac)
Girl it's all right, baby (are you still down for me baby?)
'Cause it's there in your eyes, yeah (are you still down for me?)
I can see that you want me (are you still down for me now?)
By the way that you smile (yeah, are you still down for me?)

Left once again at home
Another night on your own
Ain't no fun in loving if you're loving alone
How does it feel to be useless, oh no
Can you recall how close we used to be then
Can you still rememeber those feelings again
It seems every time I see you there's a tear in your eye
Time to make some decisions or go dying inside

(Tupac)
Tell 'em all call me a fool, but I'm stuck
It's a love thing, plus I'm overheating from the rush
Our tongues touch, kissing feeling fireworks watch the sky
I make you smile but you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and I leave now, with my heart on my sleeve memories there
What I found is you still care, you had feelings and they're still there
Babygirl keep it real here, are you still down?

Girl its all right, baby (are you still down?)
Cause its there in your eyes (its in your eyes, I can see it in your eyes)
I can see that you want me (don't ya want me, don't ya want me)
By the way that you smile (are you still down for me?)

Remember that evening
I knew that you were too scared to go all the way
But you did it to please me
Crying it was raining when you gave it to me
The more I see you the more that I feel inside
And I know one day I'll make it back to where you can fly
Watch time go
Don't cry (what you crying for?) tomorrow brings better days
Let me dry your eyes, take your burden away

(Tupac)
Only once in a lifetime, touch my soul
Go slow baby boo don't rush the flow
Got me all weak baby but I'm strong in parts
More bounce, to the ounce, with the longest sparks
Gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
Many other brothas loved you but the pleasure is mine
Mama told me how to love a woman papa was sprung
We committed, so I hit it, and its properly done
Are you still down?

Girl its all right (are you still down for me baby?)
Cause its there in your eyes (its in your eyes, I can see it in your eyes)
I can see that you want me (don't ya want me? don't ya want me?)
By the way that you smile (c'mon, c'mon, are you still down for me?)

Girl its all right baby (are you still down for me now?)
Cause its there in your eyes (its in your eyes, I can see it in your eyes)
I can see that you want me (she wants you jon, she wants you)
By the way that smile (look how she smile at you, look!)

1930,Jon B.;Babyface,Someone to Love,"Don't even like to think about it
I don't know what I'd do without it
I only know that I live and breathe for your love
Baby you came to me
In my time of need
When I needed you, you were there for me
Baby the love from you is what got me through
It's because of you, I was able to
Give my heart again, you gave me

Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know

I thought I'd never love again
I thought my life was over and
I didn't want to face or even see another day
Suddenly from no where, baby you appeared
You dried my tears, you cared for me
Maybe your love for me, truly rescued me
It's because of you, I was able to
Fall in love again, you gave me

Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know

For so long in my life, I wouldn't let love inside
But I swallowed my pride the day you arrived
Now that you're by my side
Everything is all right
It's because of you, I was able to
Give my heart again, you gave me

Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold

1931,Donell Jones,Where I Wanna Be,"(Verse one)
I just left my baby girl a message, said I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time

I could be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her
But I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how, I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

(Verse two)
Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you"

Candy coated raindrops? 
You're the same, my candy rain

All that I need in life 
All I want, all I need now I know 
I know I found it in you 
I found it in you

Girls - I'm ready
MJ - We can get it on
Girls - We can get it on
MJ - I know where I went wrong
Girls - She's where you went wrong
MJ - With you is where I belong

Girl, if I could find the words to say
I've gotta get away from a love
That kills me everyday
I'd gladly say to you

Girl, if it's all right
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight

Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine...

If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yeah, ah yeah, ah ah yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yeah, ah yeah, ah ah yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I

See my baby know, where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know when I'm next to her for sure
Oh how can they hate? Gotta get this off my chest
Oh girl, I think I love you, I swear your shit look best
Friends, they know they hate, they don't get the best
Ah yeah, I think I love you, oh baby maybe

Asking me what I'm up to
Let's find something to do
Baby I'd be down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
You know I'd be down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I see you arriving in your car
Jet black Mercedes, built in the 70s
Classic like you and me
I'll be coming down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'll be coming down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

Honestly I shouldn't waste time no more
Cause all these little boys you're chasing, did they break your heart?
I know you've been down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I won't let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

I see you the same
I see it in the way that you behave around me
And I can't tell
What we have is different from anyone else
Cause you stop doing what you're doing
When I call you come to me running
And I would do the same for you
So tell me that you feel it too

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby"

1960,Maxwell,1990x,"Like the thunder, I can hear you whisper
If love has shown, if love was shown, I would be more brave
If I can see anything I wanna entertain
But I can't, I'd rather have you next to me
But can you see that I'm alone
There's no hesitation, I feel you so much
There's no indication that I will choose your touch

There's no song that defines it
There's not music behind it
There's no lyric to read from
There's just and the moment
Lay here closely beside me
Feel my heart as it's pounded
We will climax with reason
'Cause we're grown and we own it

Inside the sky of me and lives a star
Let's ride the galaxy and find who we are

I'm hearing them saying things all the time
The word on the street is that I'm slowly losing my mind
They say that he's wasting his whole life

There's no song that defines it
There's not music behind it
There's no lyric to read from
There's just and the moment
Lay here closely beside me
Feel my heart as it's pounded
We will climax with reason
'Cause we're grown and we own it

The morning rays of Live I see you through
Till the morning dew, yeah, a winter afternoon
A summer night in June, whatever works for you
Time goes by, it just can't be more than my love, love"

Cascades down like a parachute
Bricks on my shoulders
This gravity hurts when you know the truth
I'm pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
We dreamt like martyrs
I never thought I was bold enough
You pushed me further
And I take the blame for the both of us
I'm pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Oh, Universe, hold me up
Tried your best, is it ever enough
When it's already dragging me down?
I'm pulling my weight in gold

I want you now not whenever
'Cause I want to give you better
But Baby it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl I'm that somebody
So I'm next up

Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
He only treated you like a trophy, not a gold medal

Fuck 'em girl I guess he didn't know any better
Girl that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certainly with trust we can get this together

And Lately you say he been killing the vibe
But you still role with him, why?
Pull up, skurt
Get in the ride
Left hand is steering the other is gripping your thigh
Stop playing games cause you mine
Shawty you deserve what you been missing
Baby no more games I'm down for business
Play this song for him tell him just listen

Don't
(Play this song for him...)
Don't

Girl, said he keeps on playing games and his loving ain't the same
I don't know what to say-ay but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switching lanes
And that thang so fire baby no propane
Got good pussy girl can I be frank
To keep it 100 girl I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feeling this way
Giving you the world baby when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby that's penetrate
Oh baby

Po' up we can party some mo'

I strive to do right but I'm doing so wrong
I'm living in this house but I can't call it home
He gives me what I want but it's not what I need
My mind is telling me to stay but my heart wants to leave

Said I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping with the one I love
Oh, because the one I'm with is good to me
But he just ain't good enough, oh

Yes, I've tried to shake it off, and I even tried to pray
But I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me
See he offered me the Earth, but instead chose space
I found about the cost, but it's a price I'm willing to pay

That's why I'm sleeping, sleeping with the one I love
That's why I'm sleeping, I'm sleeping I'm sleeping
Sleeping with the one I love
Cause the one who's here with me, he's good to me
But he just ain't good enough
My love, my love, my love

See my baby's like a dream but the other man, he haunts me
One is here with me but the other's got me where he wants me
Yes I got a man, but I'm still feeling lonely
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Do, do, do

I'm sleeping, sleeping, oh, I'm sleeping with the one I love
Oh, because the one I'm with, he's good to me
But he ain't good enough, oh

Damn it tears me up
And I know it's my fault
I know it's my fault

We can stay up here until we figure it out

Don't wanna be alone, be alone

I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 
I've got some damn bad intentions
I see the world in 25 dimensions
I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood heat over tension
And I know...

You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies
You can see it in my eyes
I don't wanna die

I've just got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh

Count your fears if you let me

Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking
Like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage

Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?

Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left,
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

Break up, make up, total waste of time;
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show

That's why I kiss you

And no it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part

I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it 'cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel, when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile
Ha ha ha ha ha

I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it 'cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark

I bust the windows out ya car
You should feel lucky that that's all I did
After five whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

Ooh ah...
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when...

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

(Incomprehensible) out ya car
But it don't comfort to my broken heart
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until it happens baby you don't know pain

(I believe in people like you)

So who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a areason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break and end up like before

I swear I- Always- Fall- for your type (yeah)

For your type
Tell me why I- Always- Fall- for your type
For your type

Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you movin away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just saying sh-t
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen,
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it and I fall

I swear I- Always- Fall- for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I- Always- Fall- for your type
For your type
(I just can't explain this sh-t at all)
Fall- For your type
(I just can't explain this sh-t at all)
Fall- For your type

'Cause I know I made some mistakes in the past but
I'm tired of making excuses
Listen

For whatever might have been
And all that it never was
Whatever I couldn't see
And all that I didn't want

There was a method to my madness girl
That wasn't clear to me
Until the day I saw your face
When I saw everything

For I saw us dancing through sunshine and rain
And I saw us laughing through joy and through pain
And I saw time passing but we did not change
And I still saw us together at the end of every day

Whenever you want it
Whenever you need it
Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
You better believe it
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone, no
You know, you know, you know
You should already know
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

I felt you inside myself
Before I could even feel
I knew you like no one else
But still I couldn't tell, Oh
Girl, none of it made sense to me
Girl, none of it was real
Until the day I saw your face
And it was clear to see

Whenever you want it (Whenever you want it)
Whenever you need it (Whenever you need it, baby)
Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
You better believe it (You better believe it)
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone, no (Oh, no)

I choose you

Throughout our times, people have searched their lives
Hoping that they might find the chance where they can make things right
Through my desire, thank God I found the fire
Oh, for everything has led me straight to you (Youuuu...)

Whenever you want it
Whenever you need it (Baby)
Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
You better believe it (Oh, you better believe it)
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone, no
You know, you know, you know

Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it

Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo

Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté

Girl you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl I wanna kiss it, while you kissin' your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
(Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me)

(Verse 1: Chris Brown)
I be banging all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
All that ass, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, the liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushing Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas
I skate past a nigga better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave - bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
The only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Bitch, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late

(Verse 2: Tyga)
Drive your head to a king, nigga
Dream house, my dream's bigger
Got a deck of cards if my heart switch up
Ace of spades, her eyes lit up
Diamonds glitter in my car, thriller
She pray for me, that's god willin'
I'm hard to break my boss prison
Her new name : Ass-Zilla
She love a nigga and that pussy tight
Come through, fuck you all night
Some foreplay, that's all right
But she rather do number 69
High notes, it's prime time
On a couch, hit it from behind
Hit you with that large stroke
Now she fiendin' for that good dope, yeah
That's my bae, she cook and clean and I got it made
Handcuff like she a slave, touch ya, let ya tongue taste
So high, no ceiling space
Numb to it, can't feel her face
Yeah, she numb to it, can't feel her face

(Verse 3: Chris Brown)
Blowing up my line on the cellular
She wanna lock a nigga down, on the regular
Talking crazy to me like she own the dick
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch
Momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every nigga wanna talk to her
But I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back, is my theme music
Her ass on my mind, I dream booty
Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch
Then its off with his head, how kings do it
My rings ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'
Yeah, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
My car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
Smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly

Chilling in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothing compare to what's in my pants

He will never ever, never ever love you

I know you think that I just be trippin' on ya
Boy you see, this ain't how I normally be
But I can't help this jealousy
Ooh it's taking over me, ooh I'm falling way to deep
Without you by my side I feel like I can't eat or sleep

But I, got to come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I, gotta let you go, but baby I don't wanna
And I, I gotta see, that you and me, ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you

Baby, I can't help but fantasize
Wondering what it might be like
You and I sound so right
But I'mma let it go tonight, it ain't nothin'
Coverin' my eyes
Ain't gonna see it more than twice
I get it, I got it
Baby, baby

But I, got to come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I, gotta let you go, but baby I don't wanna
And I, I gotta see, that you and me, ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you

All right, all right, all right, okay...
I see ya point, I must admit
I grind, I grind, I grind all day
This paper's what I'm try'na get
Now normally when I'm paper chasing, I be having tunnel vision
And if it's really like that lady, just turn on ya television
And there go Young, I said there go Young, you try'na get it did
Just know I gets it done, she love the I cheat
She love the way I move, I sha, I show it to her
Shows about 100, goon...
Its blacks this, black that, black car, black flags
I really hope that's money that y'all got off in them black bags
808's & heart breaks, states who puts in interstates
Giving me a bad vibe, guess I'm just a bad guy

Ciara
Throw yo' hands up in the air
If ya know he love ya

If ya know he love ya"

2047,Ciara,I Don't Remember,"What did I say to him last night?
I can't feel my face,
Try to focus but my mind ain't right.
I remember the party,
The DJ, my homies, my man and me.
But the rest of it's blurry,
Something I did made my baby go away.
Got the same clothes on today,
That I had on yesterday.
What did I do, what did I say?
But I don't remember,
Guess I had too much to drink,
'Cause I don't remember.

Oh, my car ain't outside,
How the hell did I get home?
Damn, did he drive me,
Drop me off, got his stuff and got gone?
Can't call my homies,
'Cause I'm looking and I just can't find my phone.
I need to talk to somebody.
Something I did made my baby go away.
Got the same clothes on today,
That I had on yesterday.
What did I do, what did I say?
But I don't remember,
I guess I had too much to drink,
'Cause I don't remember.
Is he gone forever?
Man, I don't know,
I just don't remember.

Oh, wish I could play back,
From beginning to the end.
I think we started dancing,
I kinda remember a kiss there.
What a cute bartender,
With that remy, that henny that's cold and gin,
'Cause I'm not a drinker.
Called in the morning,
My baby got away.
Got the same clothes on today,
That I had on yesterday.
What did I do, what did I say?
But I don't remember,
Guess I had too much to drink,
'Cause I don't remember.
Is he gone forever?
Man, I don't know,
I just don't remember.

Oh, baby, so intoxicated, had enough.
Oh, conversations, too much drinking, having fun.
What was I thinking? Just celebrating.
Oh, please forgive me, baby. I just don't remember."

2049,Ray J,One Wish,"Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"

2051,Mario,How Do I Breathe,"How do I breathe? Yeah
How do I breathe? Yeah

It feels so different being here
I was so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no one to turn to
I don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not to blame at all
Remember when I pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere
Girl I should've been right there

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Girl I'm losin' my mind
Yes I made a mistake
I thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me
I miss you so bad I can't sleep
I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me
But this can't be happening

I just had a wake up call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not blame at all
Remember when I pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere
Girl I should've been right there
(And I wonder)

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

I should've brought my love home
Baby I ain't perfect you know
Pride has got a tight hold
Girl come back to me
'Cause girl you made it hard to breathe
When your not with me

Tell me, how do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?
How do I breathe?"
2052,Mario,Couldn't Say No,"Damn
All I could do
All I could say
Is that I'm sorry

Listen
I know I really messed up this time
Just hear me out

Ooh, you should've showed me a little more love
(But still there ain't no reason)
For me to walk out on this thing called ""us""
(But you keep giving me the feeling)
That I should throw the towel in
('Cause we can't keep each other no way)
Cussin' me out in front of my friends not giving a damn how I feel

I don't even want
(I don't wanna be the guy that tricks around on you)
You don't even know
(How many times I asked ya mom what I should do)
And it's my fault
(Now it's my fault I'm in a situation I may not get through)
I got bad news that I gotta break to you and I know you gon' act a fool
But I gotta let her know

I had a girlfriend pinned up
In between the week we split up
It was lookin' so good I couldn't say no
And every time I see you wit her
I think about how I was beatin' dem ribs up
And it's a shame when a man just can't say no

See what is done is done
And I realize now ain't no taking it back
I committed the worse crime I could ever do to my gurl
(Damn she ain't gone never forgive me for that)
Everytime that you threw a fit my two-way she hits
Sayin', ""I'm on the way.""
Puttin' it down, in and out, up and down, any way I say

But baby girl I really didn't wanna
(I don't wanna be the guy who tricks around on you)
You don't even know
(How many times I asked ya mom what I should do)
She didn't even know
(Now it's my fault I'm in a situation I may not get through)
I got some real bad news to tell you and I know you gon' act a fool
She really needs to know

It was bad
(I done messed up)
Gave up all I had for you for a fast
(Piece of pleasure)
That could never replace you, one more chance
(One more chance, you mean the world to me)
Girl you made mistakes too"

2054,Mario,Like Me Real Hard,"We've had such a great time
In these past two months
I never laughed so much
In my life
It's been all about us
Since that time we had
That intimate talk
Suddenly your actin' strange
Plus your conversation
Just snapped and changed
Is it because your afraid
What you feelin' for me
Is the beginning of a
New heart break?
Hear me when I say

(Sector)
You ain't gotta
Give me your love
You ain't gotta
Say I'm your one
You ain't gotta
Tell me where you be
'Cause you ain't
Obligated to me

I'm not sayin' that
You should just
Rush and give me
Your heart
I'm just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You know just like god know
We've been broken by love
And we both need time to heal
That's why
In this short amount of time
We've grown so close
'Cause you relate
Everything I feel
So let's not complicate things
By placing titles on you and I
But what we can do
Before we make the next move
We gotta find the perfect
Reason why
So believe me when I say

(Sector)
You ain't gotta
Give me your love
You ain't gotta
Say I'm your one
You ain't gotta
Tell me where you be

I'm just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You ain't ready
To fall in love
And I ain't ready to
Care so much
We ain't ready for commitment
Right now
But together we can
Work something out

(Verse 3 : Red Cafe)
When the time is right
'Cause we will feel it in our hearts
It will be written in the stars
But for now
Just like me real hard

You ain't gotta
Give me your love
You ain't gotta
Say I'm your one
You ain't gotta
Tell me where you be
'Cause you ain't
Obligated to me

Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

2062,Rihanna,Fool In Love,"Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong,
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hole on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough"

I haven't tried to forget this

Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me

I'm doing the best that I can and
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)

Like I couldn't do it for you, like your mistress could

I know she was attractive but I was here first
I've been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you probably thinking
""What's up with B?""
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me?

I use to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying

You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor gets into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?"", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints with my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7 Eleven
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic till my voice hoarse

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?"", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Jay-Z
Hold up
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house time back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, wanna see all that shit I heard

Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight

Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""

I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights, you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

Beyoncé
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

I've been drinking watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now)
Can't keep ya eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love"
2081,Christina Aguilera,Infatuation,"He comes from a foreign place 
An island far away
Intrigues me with every move 
Till I'm breathless, I'm helpless 
Can't keep my cool 
Steals my heart when he takes my hand 
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band 
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips 
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss 

Mama used to warn me 
To beware of those Latin lovers 
She said I gave my heart too soon 
And that's how I became your mother 
I said ay mama, you seem to forget 
I'm not in love yet 
Sweet talk don't win me over 
But I realized 
Big brown eyes can hypnotize 
When he says 

I am full blood boricua 
Reads the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me, mami I need ya 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in el ritmo 
He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation 

Skin the color of cinnamon 
His eyes light up and I melt within 
Feels so good it must be a sin 
I can't stop what I started 
I'm giving in 
He brings life to my fantasies 
Sparks a passion inside of me 
Finds the words when I can not speak 
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me 

But Mama used to warn me 
Not to rush love with another 
She said I'm not trying to lecture 
I just care about my daughter 
Ay mama, you seem to forget 
I never will let 
A man control my emotions 
But when he smiles (when he smiles) 
I feel like a little child 
When he says 

I am full blood boricua 
Reads the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me, mami I need ya 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in el ritmo 
He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation 

Caught between my mama's words 
And what I feel inside 
I'm wanting to explore his world 
But part of me wants to hide 
Should I risk it, can't resist it 
This has caught me by surprise 
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico 
I can't hold back no more 
Let's go tonight... 

Papi hold me, say that you adore me
Never let go never leave me lonely 

I am full blood boricua 
Reads the tattoo on his arm 
He tells me, mami I need ya 
And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
Getting lost in el ritmo 
He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
I begin to give in with no hesitation 
Can't help my infatuation 
It's pure infatuation 

I can't help what I'm feeling 
I'm infatuated (It's pure infatuation)
(Can't help my infatuation)
Papi hold me, say that you adore me
Never let go never leave me lonely

It's pure infatuation"
2082,Christina Aguilera,Loving Me 4 Me,"People ask if I'm in love with you
Because I'm sitting here with your picture
And smiling to myself (I smile)
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say yes (yes)

What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak (speak) and I can't think
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free
Free, and let me be me
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me (loving me)
Is that you're loving me for me (ooh)

People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star

Unconditionally you're there for me
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, oh so sweet
This is meaningful, it's incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so surreal
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me (loving me)
Is that you're loving me for me (oh oh yeah)

It's so amazing how something so sweet
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me

Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
He's real, he's honest, and he's loving me for me
Yeah"
2083,Christina Aguilera,Impossible,"It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible for me to give you what you need
If you're always hidin' from me

I don't know what hurt you
But I just, I wanna make it right
'Cause boy I'm sick tired of tryin' to read your mind

'Cause it's impossible (impossible)
Ooh baby it's impossible (impossible)
For me to love you this way
It's impossible (impossible)
Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)
If you're makin' it this way

Impossible to make it easy
If you're always tryin' to make it so damn hard
How can I, how can I give you all my love baby oh
If you always, always puttin' up your guard

This is not a circus
So don't ya play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down oh

It's impossible (impossible)
Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)
For me to love you, this way (this way)

2084,Christina Aguilera,Lift Me Up,"So the pain begins
As the music fades
And I'm left here with
With more than I can take

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try

When the static clears
And all is said and done
I will realize
That we all need someone

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try

So when you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all

If you lift me up
If you lift me up

Said if you lift me up
Will you lift me higher

When you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all

If you lift me up
Said if you lift me up
If you lift me up
Just get me through this night"
2085,Christina Aguilera,Blank Page,"I know there's hurt
I know there's pain
But people change
Lord knows I've been no saint

In my own way
Regret choices I made
How do I say I'm sorry
How do I say I'm sorry

I was scared
I was unprepared
Oh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything
For us to make it through

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page
Waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart
Let me be your eye
I am a blank page
Waiting for life to start

Then our hearts stop
And beat as one together
Then our hearts stop
And beat as one forever

How can I erase
Decisions I've made
How do I go back
What more can I say
All that remains
Are hearts filled with shame
How do we say we're sorry
How do we say we're sorry

I was scared
I was unprepared
Oh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything
For us to make it through

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page
Waiting for you to bring me to life
Oh, paint me a heart
Let me be your eye
I am a blank page
Waiting for life to start

Then our hearts stop
And beat as one together
Then our hearts stop
And beat as one forever

(Let our hearts stop)
I go back in time
And I realize
Our spirit's alike
And we never die

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I'll be a blank page
Waiting for you to bring me to life
Oh, paint me a heart
Let me be your eye
I am a blank page
Waiting for life to start

And let our hearts stop
And beat as one together
Let our hearts stop
And beat as one forever"

Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

Perfect - ain't saying that I am
Proven, least I'm provin' that I give a damn

2096,Usher,Foolin' Around,"I know I vowed to never do this again but I
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at

Got something that you need to know
You're the realest s*** I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know, that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

Let me start by saying that the way I
Feel for you has never once changed
And the games I've played, mistakes I made
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know

We got a problem, baby, I can't lie 'cause lately I realize
That I never knew that we was on the same playing field
Knew that it was wrong but we let it be
And I know you never knew when you said, ""I do""
That you would have to face all the pain you feel

It's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl, said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess it's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And then spotlight feel like the bright light
But it's really just my fears and it still don't dry your tears

When I, say she ain't you and I really love you more
When you say if it's true why'd you do it for?
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl, said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

What I feel I don't even gotta write it, it's like poison in my body
And there's no way to deny that my heart is a time bomb
With seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows

That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what am, I will be

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl and I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

Live with this, can you live with this, girl?
I just want you to know

When you fucked her I survived by you

Praying for myself 'cause I be all truth

But I don't waste my time tryna prove that I'm something to see, oh I
The real ones they know and the ones that do not I don't need
'Cause mostly the vision and I give reasons to believe

That I'm honest, I'm honest, I'm telling no lies
When I say I'm up next I'm not just for the ride
Never a point when I questioned my mind
Know what I'm doing, I pay for this time
Come up regardless, I'm coming regardless
I'm hungry, I'm starving, remaining a topic
Never an option, got your undivided whenever I'm plotting

Don't take it personal, personal, personal
Don't take it personal, personal, personal

I don't want it (na, na, na), don't need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don't want it (na, na, na), don't need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I know that you hear this and you gon' just know that I'm speaking to you
Shouldn't have got so ahead of yourself now you're losing your cool
I know that you know that I'm right, you admit it that I am the truth
But look you at you now, look at your face, looking sad in the booth

Signed off a tape, chewed off a tape, did it alone, and I ain't touched a plate
You was my nigga, we could have been great
You so far gone, got you thinking you're safe
All said and done you lost my respect
All said and done you're the one I regret
Now you gon' watch from the crowd
Lookin' up like the rest

Don't take it personal, personal, personal (Look)
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
(I need you to promise me one thing)
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
(That you not gon' take it like that)
I don't want it, don't need it
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
(Promise me that you won't take it)
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
(Swear to me that you won't take it)
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don't want it, don't need it

No, I could never judge anyone I loved
Even if you lose sight of all the things I've done
I'm not who I once was
These days I'm all grown up
I fuck with me heavy
I'm all chose up

And I only did right by you
When you fucked her I survived by you
Praying for the girls that believe your news
Praying for myself 'cause I be all truth
I got good heart, good soul, good sex, no stress
Next for me is best
Don't you run your mouth
Cause in this song I say it best

Don't take it personal, personal, personal
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don't want it, don't need it
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
Don't take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know

I don't care if they take the house and all the rides,
If they throw me in jail and it doesn't feel alive,
'Cause I already lost it all, lost it all
'Cause I already lost it all, lost it all
When I lost you.

My soldier, my lover,
My hommie and my friend,
I swear I give it all back just to hold you once again
Told me you would give your life if it came down to it
Oh, it came down to it, now I'm going through it
And I'm about to lose it.

I don't care if they take the house and all the rides,
If they throw me in jail and it doesn't feel alive,
'Cause I already lost it all, lost it all
'Cause I already lost it all, lost it all
When I lost you.

I lost every reason in the world to go on (go on)
'Cause you never miss a good thing till it's gone (gone)
Oh, the life ain't what it seems, give your heart and soul to the street
Just to end up breaking down to you knees
Heaven, I know you hear me baby I'm coming home.

So I don't care if they take the house and all the rides
They can throw me in jail tell the judge he can give me life
'Cause I already lost it all, lost it all (said I lost it)

Lost it all
Said I can't find nobody better now
I'm missing you

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make

Your silly games I won't allow

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special places in my heart
He was my lover from the start

You need to give it up

On the balcony ripping the rails
Slowly I'm pulling you near
Sayin' shhhh babe don't make to much noise

Emotions running high
My hands planted on your thighs
You feel me going up and down

Girl your drive wait in the back seat
Windows tinted it's getting deep
Fog all over the glass
I don't know how long I can last
With you moaning crazy

And when I'm done you'll be fast asleep

Listen...
He got older, but never grew;
For his life, he can't tell the truth...
How to love, he ain't got a clue,
Playin' games like he'll never lose you...

Try to talk to him, can't get through;
Every day, he's a different dude...
These are the signs of a grown-ass boy;
Better run for the hills - I'm just trying to keep it real...

(You can't raise a man...) He's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he (acts like a boy...) It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you...
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody - if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody,
'Cause you (can't raise a man...) No, no...

Coming home any time at night, 
Expecting you to let it ride...
How many tears are you gonna cry? 
Playin' games like he'll never lose you...
You know that the love is changed; 
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown-ass boy;
Better run for the hills - I'm just keeping it real!

(You can't raise a man...) He's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he (acts like a boy...) It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you...
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody - if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody;
You (can't raise a man...) No, no...

Gonna take more than a miracle (A miracle...) to change him - just let him go; (Just let him go...)
Tell me, when will you decide to do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think you can train that boy to be a man? it's too late;
Better off letting him go;
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise...

(Can't raise a man...) He's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he (acts like a boy...) It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you...

Feels so damn good to be cold, 
And I don't even care if you know...

I'ma let 'em kiss my body, touch my body, record it, and make sure you find it;
How you gon' trip? Boy, you been with everybody...
You started, I'ma finish;
You made that bed, now you gon' lay in it...

You gon' suffer, you gon' suffer for everything you did;
You gon' suffer, you gon' suffer - I done took too much of this...

You gon' cry, you gon' pay me in tears;
You gon' cry - you owe me for all these years...
You gon' cry, 'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge,
So cry, cry...

I learned from the best, I learned from you;
It's easy to do the shit that you do...
I can just switch it up on you - used to be me that was out here stressin';
So your gift became a curse - now you miss your blessing...

You gon' suffer, you gon' suffer for everything you did;
I'm not bitter - stay with her - maybe she can take your shit...

You gon' cry, you gon' pay me in tears;
You gon' cry - you owe me for all these years...
You gon' cry, 'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge,
So cry, cry...

I just had to get my point across before all we had was lost...
Now we are both hurt by the one we love;
I know it's wrong, but I wanna see you...

Cry, cry...
Cry, cry...

You gon' cry, you gon' pay me in tears;
You gon' cry - you owe me for all these years...

I remember the days you used to love me
(Oh you used to love me)

I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time

You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away
(Repeat first verse)

Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real

You used to love me every day
Now your love has gone away

The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around

And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says Hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
Taken every time...
Taken every time...

Dancing,
With your body close to mine

I want you forever
But good intentions never win
I've got that feeling
Tonight I'll be alone again

I've been thinking
How good it was
When you were here
And it ain't the wine
That I've been drinking
For once I feel my head
Is clear

But early this morning
When I opened up my eyes
That old lonesome feeling
Took me by surprise
I guess you meant more to me
Than I realized

The love we had stays on my mind

And lately girl
I've been remembering
The good times
That we used to share
My thoughts of you
Don't have an ending
And memories of you are
Everywhere

But what should I tell you
It's not your concern
You win some
You lose some
And I've lost
And I've learned
Sisqo's so lonely
With no place to turn
And here at the end
Yes I do

The love we had stays on my mind

Girl if you were nearer
If you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears
(You don't know, don't know how I cry baby)
And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer

How I wish that you were hear

How I wish, oh I wish
How I wish that you were here

And baby girl
I was tired
So I laid down
To dream for a little while
But lately I've been so
So uninspired
Without the comfort
Of your smile

But I'm not complaining
Cause that's how it goes

But nobody knows
Nobody know's baby

2168,Future;Rihanna,Selfish,"Ooh, yeah

It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly

Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns
Saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh, let's not be alone
Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight
Tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah

I just hit the liquor side of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies
Ain't no love without us
It will die
Roses turn into dust
Every night
We gettin' more popular
Wrong is right
When it comes to us

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Tonight, let's be selfish
Selfish, tonight, tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah

I'll be selfish

Ain't never been a man wanting anything
As much as I want you
The sun don't come up till morning so tonight there's no excuse (mmm)
Just like the rain outside I'll make your love come down
So baby now its time, just can't wait no more, I'm gon' give you what ur body's been cryin for...
And if you tell me yes ill lay you down,
Girl we ain't gotta rush just play around
We'll do it like we never done before
So go and lock that door, baby don't worry 'cause I'll be gentle

Come on, baby turn the lights off let's get naked (Ooh come on)
Come on, baby girl you know I just can't take it (I can't take it no more)

It seems like you're ready
So come on, girl I just can't wait to see us naked (us naked)
But naked

I know you want this girl, I can see it in your eyes
Don't be ashamed of what you got between those thighs, oh
You know I'm gon try not to be so excited, (but I can't help it)
Feels so good to be invited
So baby get ready 'cause here I go-o... hey

Take off your shoes, I wanna see your toes,
Slip off that skirt, and that shirt's gotta go
Come out them drawers, girl you won't be needin those
Now you're wearing what I like, baby let's go
Come on...

There's something bout that sexy skin you're in
Your clothes don't do you justice, so come out of them
So baby take it off, so I can break you off
And give you love, love, love
Now its time to enjoy yourself,
If you need assistance, baby girl I'm here to help
'Cause it's time for us to start this love makin'
But first we gotta get butt naked

Damn girl (hey) you look so good
Won't you come over here (over here)
Slip off that skirt, you know that shirt gotta come off (baby baby baby)
You're lookin' kinda right, now you know it's time

2171,Ray J,One Wish,"Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"

Butt-naked in the classroom
On the teacher's school desk

Call me Slick-Em hound

And then I lick 'em down
I'm on point
And best believe I ain't no teaser
I wanna get deep and a little bit of deep and a little bit of deeper
Sweeping you off your feet
Like a rake
Talking 'bout Slick-Em wait

Till I feel the backboard break

Yo special lover man
And I'll do anything
That you want me to do

Massage your body

You so juicy you know where
And I wanna put my you know what

Crushed in my fingertips
Wanna caress your hips
Rub my lips against your lips

Wanna press my body against yours
Feel the sweat coming from our pores
I'm pushing harder inside ya
Forget mine girl get yours
