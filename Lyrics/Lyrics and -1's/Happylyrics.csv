1,The Jackson 5,I Want You Back,"Let me tell you now

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)

Yes I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na na na na

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh huh

A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby (baby)

(I want you back)
Forget what happened then
And let me live again

Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Spare me of this cause
Gimme back what I lost

Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
I tell ya that I love you
Baby, ow, baby, baby
I want you back
I want you back"

3,Otis Redding,Stand By Me,"When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

Darlin', darlin', stand by me-e, stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me"
4,The Supremes,You Can't Hurry Love,"I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches
Must I stand before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength, yeah
It's almost gone
I remember mama said:

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?

No I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said:

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

No, love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said:

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

6,Stevie Wonder,For Once In My Life,"For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dream come true, yeah, yeah, yeah (for once in my life)

For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (not like it's hurt before)
For once I have something
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
(Someone who needs me) A-heh, heh, hey yeah
(Someone who needs me) Oh, I'm in love baby

(For once in my life)

For once in my life (for once in my life)
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (not like it's hurt before)
For once I have something
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
(Someone who needs me) Whoa, for once in my life
(Someone who needs me) Hey, somebody that needs me
(Someone who needs me) Ooh baby, for once in my life"

8,The Temptations,My Girl,"I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooo-ooo, hoo-ooo

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah

I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
Talkin' bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl"
9,Marvin Gaye,Got To Give It Up (Part 1),"I used to go out to parties and stand around
'Cause I was too nervous to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought somebody could choose me

No more standing there beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin', there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, spread out and let me in

Baby, just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up, turn it 'round
Ooh, shake it down, ow

You can love me when you want to, babe
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine

You're movin' your body
Easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin', baby
You wanna turn me out
I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe

Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up

If you want it, you've got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up"
10,Jackie Wilson,(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher & Higher,"Your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forever more

You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (your love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and it soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again

That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (your love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)

Yes, that one in a million girls
And I whip my loving arms around you
Honey, I can stand up and face the world

Let me tell ya, your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (your love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
And I said your love (lifting, lifting, lifting)

11,Stevie Wonder,Sir Duke,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands

But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget:
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringin' out
There's no way the band could lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over, all over people

Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people
Come on!"

14,The Supremes,Come See About Me,"I've been crying (ooh, ooh)
Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fears

That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me crying, baby, for you
Keeps me sighing, baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Keep on crying, baby, for you
I'm gonna keep sighing, baby, for you

So come on, hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)

Sometimes up (ooh, ooh)
Sometimes down (ooh, ooh)
My life's so uncertain (ooh, ooh)
With you not around (ooh, ooh)

From my arms you may be out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep
Keeps me crying, baby, for you
Keep on, keep on crying, baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely
(Come see about me)
I love you only
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back - let's go back
A let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't a been too much more than ten (just a child)

I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees

You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
(What you're tryin' to do to me)
Oh-oh-oh think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walk around everyday
Playin' games and takin' scores
Tryin' to make other people lose their mind
Well, be careful you don't lose yours

Oh think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Woo-hoo, think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me)
And I need you (don't cha' know)
Without each other
There ain't nothin' either can do

You come and you go (You come and you go)

When I call your name
Girl, it starts to flame (Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart)
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight

I'm a poorman's son from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye

When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight, because my heart is true

She says baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight

She's a pearl of a girl
I guess that's what you might say 
I guess her folks brought her up that way 
The right side of the tracks she was born and raised 
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids

She says no one is better than I 
And I know I'm just an average guy 
No footfall hero or smooth Don Juan 
Got empty pockets you see, I'm a poor man's son

Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never never make my baby cry 
And it's all right, what if I can't do 
Out of sight, because my heart is true 

She says baby everything is all right 
Uptight, clean out of sight 
Baby, everything is all right 
Uptight, clean out of sight

Baby everything is all right 
Uptight, clean out of sight 
Baby, everything is all right 
Uptight, way out of sight"

But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all
Oh little girl

In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
And maybe you think that love was made for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules
Oh little girl

In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said if you feel like giving me

And if you listen oh so carefully
The winds that ride on the high tide
Whistles a melody
So the people started to sing
And that's how the surf gave birth I'm told
To California soul, California soul

When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've got to move
'Cause it's really such a groove

Puts a brand new kind
Of thinkin' in your mind
And you can't go wrong
'Cause you're groovin' all day long

California soul, California soul

They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete, yes
Until they saw two lovers kissin'
They knew just what was missin'
So happy they were rockin' and reelin
Because they had added that lovin' feeling

You beat me to the punch, that time
You beat me to the punch oh, oh, oh, oh
You beat me to the punch

Whoa, after I hadn't known you for it seemed like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours
You beat me to the punch one more time
You beat me to the punch oh, oh, oh, oh
You beat me to the punch, yeah

Since I love you I thought you would be true
And love me tender, so I let my heart surrender
To you, yes I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day
And beat you to the punch

Found my mind in a brown paper bag within
Tripped on a cloud, fell eight miles high
Tore my mind on a jagged sky
Hey, I dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

Pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
Watched myself crawling out as I was crawling in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
Saw so much till I broke my mind
Hey, I dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Yeah yeah yeah, see what condition I was in
Hey yeah baby, see what condition I was in

I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
Saw so much till I broke my mind
I dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

Someone painted ""April fool"" in big black letters on a dead-end sign
I had my foot on the gas since I left the road and I blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I dropped in, check out this condition my condition was in

I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Hey, check out the condition, oh, my condition
Yeah, oh what condition my condition was in
Oh, check it out
I got to see what condition it's in
Hey, I got to check out my condition and see...

I want to stop, and thank you baby
I just want to stop, and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
 
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
 
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Oh, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does
Seems to come out right

Once I went to hear them play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized
By the sound this cat put down
When I saw this short, fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the man got down
When he finally reached his goal

You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man

Got that rubber band
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose

Guaranteed to blow your mind
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
Where in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord
Lord, help him get away

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man

When the rubberband starts to jam

How much of this stuff do he think we can stand?
So much rhythm, grace, and debonair for one man, Lord
And then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe
Slip it through his knee, got the feeling in his head, y'all
Aw, come on, baby

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control

Got the people all in his wake
Everything probably seems outta place

As a matter of taste to be exact

No muscle bound man could take my hand
From my guy (my guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place

He looked kinda nice and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home to meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side

And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me

I want to stay around
So make me yours, make me yours
You already captured my heart and my soul

I never thought I'd be lucky enough to meet
A guy with all your charms to hold me with loving arms
Make me feel secure and warm

Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up

In my arms, why don't you stay

Need ya, need ya

Why must we seperate, my love

Why you do me like you do
I get this need

Ooh, ah-ooh
Need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away
Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me

After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

And the pages have always been blink like the trees in the wild

If the memories we make, will never been lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
And time in time, I know when it's time to leave

And the memories we've made, will never be lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost

Even if it was just a day,
You won't forget the one who's making you shake

Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won't forget the man who's making you shake

Is covered in ivy green

Takes me away 
Takes me away 

The scent you wear moves in lines 
From your apartment into mine 
You act like you don't know me 
My god, you tempt my anxious mind 

It takes me away 
Takes me away 
Takes me away 

Would it be much better if I knew nothing about you 
Would it be much better if I knew nothing about you

You confuse me with your riddles and your sudden generosity

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

You can have it when you come by, you can have yourself a one-man way
I saw you when it caught your eye and it's such a petty price to pay

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't be out this late
Really wanna make you feel home
Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't get this fucked up
Really wanna get it to you

Swallow till you go blind and find a little company

You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink

The blacklist and it's hosts
Came down so swift and it drove 'em to the coast
We're goin' California but we're all out of work
I guess that's better than a grave and a hearse oh oh

108,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord
Were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits
So I'll play my part

I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom and a place for the end

I won't be late for this, late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time, ah"

Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wonderin' eyes of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear

I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit

There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sent
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh little bit

You look so worn, so thin
You're a taker, devil's maker
Let me hear you sing, hey ya, hey ya

Wolf father at the door
You don't smile anymore
You're a drifter, shape-shifter
Let me see you run, hey ya, hey ya

Holy light, oh, burn the night
Oh, keep the spirits strong
Watch it grow, child of wolf
Keep holding on

When I run through the deep
Dark forest long after this begun
Where the sun would set
Trees were dead and the rivers were none

And I hope for a trace
To lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound
There was only me and my disgrace

Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey

You look so worn, so thin
You're a taker, devil's maker
Let me hear you say, hey ya, hey ya

Wolf father at the door
You don't smile anymore
You're a drifter, shape-shifter
Let me see you run, hey ya, hey ya

Wayward winds
The voice that sings of a forgotten land
See it fall, child of wolf
Lend a mending hand

When I run through the deep dark forest
Long after this begun
Where the sun would set
Trees were dead and the rivers were none

And I hope for a trace
To lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound
There was only me and my disgrace

Just 'cause I steal the things you hide,
Just 'cause I focus while we're dancing,
Just 'cause I offered you a ride.

Still I am not from Barcelona,
I am not even from Madrid.
I am a native of the North Pole
And that can mess up any kid.

Well if you could reinvent my name,
Well if you could redirect my day,
I wanna be the King of Spain.

And I will settle in Pamplona
And I'll provoke the bulls with words
And then I'll send a man to meet them all
But he's fake, so I have heard.

And all the senoritas sighing,
Will be the fountain of my lies.
But while we're floating in siestas
You search for bottles and for knives.

Well if you could reinvent my name,
Well if you could redirect my day,
I wanna be the King of Spain.

And I wear my boots of Spanish leather
Oh while I'm tightening my crown.
I'll disappear in some flamenco
Perhaps I'll reach the other side.

Why are you stabbing my illusion?
Just 'cause I stole some eagle's wings
Because you named me as your lover
Well, I thought I could be anything.

Well if you could reinvent my name,
Well if you could redirect my day,
I wanna be the King of Spain."

She got a young man that she plays with like a toy
He don't mind when she call him little boy
That's a thing that he enjoys

She wants to give it all back but it's a little too late
He want to start all over, want a shiny clean slate.
Just skin him like a snake and hang him up over the gate.
Don't believe it? Just you wait

We can weep and call it singing

Where we pray when our hearts are strong enough
We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood
Where we see enough to follow
We can hear when we are hollow
Where we keep the light we're given
We can lose and call it living

Where the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every night knows how long it's supposed to last
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine

Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray
Where our water isn't hidden
We can burn and be forgiven
Where our hands hurt from healing
We can laugh without a reason

'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every moon in our bodies make shining glass
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine"

136,Of Monsters and Men,Dirty Paws,"Jumpin' up and down the floor
My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talkin' trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

So, for a while things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws"

154,Hozier,Jackie and Wilson,"So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows outta nowhere on a candle of the wild
Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
'Cause, Lord, she found me just in time

'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me, call me ""baby""
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care

We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God, it wasn't for us

She's gonna save me, call me ""baby""
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care

We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the green at night, let my mind reset
Looking up from the cigarette and she's already left
I start picking up the art for what's left of me and our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me, call me ""baby""
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care

We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise em on rhythm and blues"

Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
At playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side-by-side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
'Bout the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends"

And I fell heavy into your arms

Will blow away with this new sun

Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you

And relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget

And I will wait, I will wait for you

And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind freed from the lies

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground, woo

We'll raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

Going so fast, every doubt we had is coming undone
And falling behind with everything we left there
We held on for far too long

And now we pass so many people on the road
They could come along, I wish they'd been told
They may call it a shot in the dark
From what we know, it's not unheard of

And we'll one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

Our favorite parts are what we'll keep
Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories
So everything else has room to grow
'Cause in better light, everything changes

So we can one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

There's no race, there's only a runner
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race there's only a runner
1, 2, 3 even when you get tired
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race, no ending in sight
No second too short, no window too tight

Just turn off the lights when you leave
'Cause we've got everything we're gonna need
We're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run child
We gotta run, we gotta run, we gotta run child

One day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

One day tell our story
Of how we made something

Six years ago
Felt the shadow strangle home
And the worry, oh no the phone
I hear the mourning, please come home
 
Within my own regret, my spirit go
Leaves the fires, the final blow
Get in conflict, I do recall
From the darkness calling for
 
I'll call for you
Choking on the white noise rushing
Howling from the great beyond
I'll call for you
I recall the fires raining down
 
There was yearing, stone cold
With the seaming waves of war
And the name breaks, haunting on
I lost key of all that ever were

Some as strong men, some sick may call
Seen the judge before your own
Then you worry, your ways are mourning
Found my heart in those who gave you warmth
 
I'll call for you
Choking on the white noise rushing
Howling from the great blue
I'll call for you
I recall the fires raining down

Like worn leather boots, of color and size that would last
Caught them a lark in a trap and each held a wing
Then they tore it apart, before that small bird could sing

Confused by the wind, bruised by the size of the rain
She turned in to him, begged for the light to remain
But plans have been made, all the furniture sold
So store up your hate, use it for warmth when you're cold

For I have seen no joy, only danger
I see no joy, only strangers
I see no joy, see no joy in this world
Should you choose to go, please be careful of
Lonesome roads, men who travel them will not know
Will not know of your ways

Still I have seen no joy, only dangers
I see no joy, only strangers
I see no joy, see no joy in this world
You should choose to go
Please remember what you have learned from the little bird
Always dear, always dear to my heart"

So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

Is this it
This is it

So they paid you to scream
But it buried your dreams
So you wait for the pain that will send you to sleep again

Now you walk with your wolves
Like you got nothing to lose
Act like you don't care while you pray for a cross to bear

But it's not the way you can't afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

Is this it
This is it



Is this it

This is it

But it's not the way you can't afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose

This is it

186,Of Monsters and Men,Mountain Sound,"I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I had caused with my two hands
Alone we traveled
Armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

We sleep until the sun goes down
We sleep until the sun goes down

We sleep until the sun goes down

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran"

All I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee.
And if I was a tree growing tall and greeen
All I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves

If I was a flower growing wild and free
All I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee.
And if I was a tree growing tall and green
All I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves

All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.

If you were a river in the mountains tall,
The rumble of your water would be my call.
If you were the winter, I know I'd be the snow
Just as long as you were with me, let the cold winds blow

All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.

If you were a wink, I'd be a nod
If you were a seed, well I'd be a pod.
If you were the floor, I'd wanna be the rug
And if you were a kiss, I know I'd be a hug

All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.

If you were the wood, I'd be the fire.
If you were the love, I'd be the desire.
If you were a castle, I'd be your moat,
And if you were an ocean, I'd learn to float.

All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea."

And by the looks of things she may well have done the same,
But I swear I know that face but I don't know her name,
She's the shape of love.

I stir my tea and throw away wet cigarettes,
I watch her shivering through her rain sodden dress,
I know her make up runs and her hair may be a mess,
But she's the shape of love.

I don't ever want the rain to stop,
I don't ever want to leave this coffee shop,
I don't ever want the clouds to part,
'Cause the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.

I only came inside to get out of the wind,
But now I'm here let it blow yeah let it sing,
'Cause I don't know how this ones gonna end or how it may begin,
But she's the shape of love.

I don't ever want the sun to shine,
I don't ever want to leave this one behind,
I don't ever want the summer time to start,
'Cause the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.

I don't ever want the rain to stop,

And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing

And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it be Love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
And although not really, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time, I might not know you
In five years time, we might not speak at all
In five years time, we might not get along
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong

And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done

Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Was never much, but we've made the most
Welcome home

Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost

Peel the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
I've come home

All my nightmares escape my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs
I feel your thumbs
Press into my skin again"

200,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

And then you say ""love, baby, let's go back to my flat""
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason so man, put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs

Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that

No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips, through my heartbeat thumb

And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say ""love, this is what is all about""
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore

Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days"

I used to stay awake, just counting hours on my thumb
I had so many empty rooms inside the chateau
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm done with sharing space with people that I don't know
Trading pieces of my heart, it left a shadow
I had so many empty rooms inside the chateau, yeah

But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy ever since I met you
No vacancy 'cause of you

Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

I used to be the type to never take the chance, oh
Had so many walls, you'd think I was a castle
I spent so many empty nights with faces I don't know

But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy ever since I met you
No vacancy 'cause of you

Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
When I fell, I fell, I fell, I fell for you
So no vacancy, no vacancy

Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can't find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healing
And I was runnin' out of luck
I never thought I'd find this feeling

'Cause I've been hearing symphonies

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Céilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

To see the colors and all the kids going home

I've been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do

I've been running
On a wheel like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond, I'm trying
I'm fighting, right into the rhythm now

I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night
With you, with you, you

Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)

There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you, with you

Put it up in the air
If you don't really care
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there

Put it up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there

Put it up in the air (up all night with you)

When the tide wash me in
You and I no longer a thing
Unrepentantly I've waited for you

Dissolves my selfish leanings and all the others
Guide me
You beside me
With conviction-my lost invention
My child is starving

But you keep me, you keep me
I've been locked and you're the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me till I'm ready to be free

Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
Forgetting what giving and living can be-what it can mean
First forgiving myself and stepping outside of my own apathy
To see, I just want to be

Patient like the forest
Stood through thousands fallen
Watched the changing evening a million times or more
Lead me to the water
Take me to the other side
And know how much it means, to me

'Cause you keep me, you keep me
I've been locked and you're the key

Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
I've forgotten what giving and living can be-what it can mean
First steps to being better is doing the smallest things

Like a prayer, you don't expect an answer
Though you ask for one

And sure my love would come along
Like some little bird and only I would recognize its home
Like the actors I seen on the television
With the stage lights on

What I found was a gamble
You threw yourself in with me
Made a cross and you lit a candle

But we were only strangers cornered in a dark room
Projecting slides of cozy lives on the wall
In the dark I thought I saw you
Or was it nothing at all

Of everyone I ever knew
I'm giving it all to you
I'm asking everything in return
And I have nothing left to lose
I'll get it back through you
And take your offer

It's time I wake and I'm still alive
Now in my expiration date imagine my surprise
Some backwards take on the book of Job
His life was a wager and mine's a joke
Give him what he wants, he will never know
He's tired of trying to let himself go

Of everyone I ever knew
I've gotten used to you
I've grown attached to you being here
With everyone I ever knew
I've learned to count on you
As my own fingers

You're running late with half your makeup on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough they'll be a different role to fill

I love this feeling
But I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much
I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong, but my head is loose

She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me

The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate, there's just no landing pad
And better have said it, but darling you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the penrose steps

I hate this feeling
But I love this part
She really wants to make it work
And I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a waterslide
As soon as I get home

Oh and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong, but surely worst to leave
And she hits like ecstasy

So free up the cheaper seats

Falling, thinking 'bout you
Buzzing by myself at night
Same place, same old rhyme
Same troubles on my mind too
I still chase and don't know why
Forever and ever, you'd never believe
For better or worse, this is all just a dream
Whenever the pressure got you on your knees
Just take it or leave it as long as you're free

Cut me loose
Puttin' my, puttin' my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Alleluja, baby now, baby now stand up
Make your move to the beat of my, beat of my drum

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums

One day, I realized
I'm never satisfied, I'm too
Drunk on this lullaby
Forever and ever, we'd never approve
Why everyone's ending; it's always too soon
Remember whenever you're black and you're blue
Don't fake it to feel it, whatever you do

Cut me loose
Puttin' my, puttin' my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Alleluja, baby now, baby now stand up
Make your move to the beat of my, beat of my drum

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums

Going, going off the deep end
Reaching, preaching out to my friends
Hoping, hoping I see you again

Cut me loose
Puttin' my, puttin' my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Alleluja, baby now, baby now stand up
Make your move to the beat of my, beat of my drum

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum

Born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies
All you want's one more Saturday
But look here until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
'Til the day

They come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes

You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried

A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep them folded in your lap
And raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Just the same

Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late?
Or changed by a potion
And find a handsome young mate for you to love?

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Well do it now or grow old
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold

Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this is so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary

Dare to be one of us, girl
Facing the android's conundrum
I felt like I should just cry

But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
You're Himmler in your coat
You don't know how long I have been
Watching the lantern dim
Starved of oxygen
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window"

I'm thinking of you dear,
Every moment of the way.
I tied my hands with rope now watch you escape,
And I make no mistake.

There's a demon on the loose,
He's a head under our floor.
'Cause I saw him late last night,
Knocking on my bedroom door.

I have surely saved my blood,
Popping through my body's face.

Start sniffing around the continuous strife
Grab fear by a strange hand
Sweet neglection in her own right

I wouldn't change her, trade or ditch
I love her just the way she is
All of her flaws and friends
Don't care what anybody says about her

She has a spear and a vow of mother nature
You'll never know what she'll do
Hardened from her mysterious sun
I'm not a muse, I play the fool

I stop trying to make sense of it all
Start dancing around the continuous strife
Grab fear by a strange hand
Keep her cool under the pale moonlight

I wouldn't change her, trade or ditch
I love her just the way she is

As they were crying down below

I can't get it out of my mind

By sharing all your feathers
Bury all the treasure
But I won't play the part
One day you will hear me
Hunting in the dark
Taking back my halo
So this is where we part

As they were crying down below
And I can't get it out of my mind

In a boat to the Netherlands
We appear and recall

The way is a way, think slowly
The sun is standing lighted

I want to know that certainty is in my life
I want to know that certainty is in the light
I want to know that certainty is in my life
Isn't lonely and more defined

You've got, you've got the mission and the pieces
In hand off beneath you stand
We turn we make the scenes to never neverlands
On the sun to the Netherlands
We appear to all

The way is a way, think slowly
The sky turning, sending light in

I want to know that certainties in my life
I want to know that certainties in the light
I want to know that certainties in my life
Isn't lonely and more defined"

An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration

'Cause I'm a red-blooded man
But I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

'Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

Bent crooked in the light around you
Bathing in the sight of the others

I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

It was hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call

I met you in the dead of winter
I stood stranded in the water
Dug deeper than a crooked splinter
I turned away from all the others

Sad hopes I'd hidden under
Tangled inside of me
You spoke like broken thunder
Deep into the center of me

Over cracks along under the trees
I know this town grounded in a compass
Cardinal landed in the dogwood

I keep going over it over and over
My steps iterate my shame
How come every outcome's such a comedown?
Lately afternoon with the shades drawn down

I kept saying I just wanted to see you
Saying, ""What's wrong with that?""
Needles shaking outlines in a compass
Every outcome's such a comedown

I knew it when I saw it
So I did just what I wanted
So I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it

I saw your boyfriend at the port authority
It's a sort of fucked up place
Well so I averted my stride on a quick one
He's coming back from going over to your place, huh?

I feel like I could forget about it
I feel like I could mellow out
I don't feel undone in a big way
There's nothing really bad to be upset about

But when I thought I was getting better
I woke up on the ground
An appointment or disappointment
I set back, oh, another comedown

As if I needed a reminder
Oh, I do only what I want to
So I go through with this

Walking out in the nighttime springtime
Needling my way home
I saw Leah on the bus a few months ago
I saw some old friends at her funeral

My steps keep splitting my grief
Through these solipsistic moods
I should call my parents when I think of them
Should tell my friends when I love them

Maybe I should have gone out a bit more
When you guys were still in town
I got too caught up in my own shit
It's how every outcome's such a comedown

And I knew it when I saw it
Oh, I did just what I wanted
So I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it"

You know the better days still remain
Can I be insane forever?

Who knew, my ingenue
That we could never be together
Unless we do a deed we can't undo?
And even if you sing that song
We could be right, or we could be so wrong
Feed the dream, does it seem that we're pushing at the sun?

And if you loved her, would you fake it?
And every letter, would you burn it?
Cause every time I hear the way she said it
I can't let go, I can't let go

I say
If I could make you fade away
I could play the game I know so well
It's a fair trade

Many of the things I said
Are made from the beautiful things I regret
From the words we made, I feel the pain
Can I know if it's worth it, never?

I knew, there's an avenue
Everybody leaves a piece of their heart
On the street for us all to view
And even if I feel alone
I know I'm just a man of flesh and bone
Feed the dream, does it seem that we're staring at the sun?

And if you loved her, would you fake it?
And every letter, would you burn it?
Cause every time I hear the way she said it

One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you

I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger

Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes

Just let me love you
Just let me love, just let me love
Just let me love you

But these walls don't talk

That's wishful thinkin'
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinkin'
Is anything forever or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

From Brooklyn to New York, then off to the West
In Cali, no Khaled, but fuck, we the best
My stripes, stay American, lemme express
And I keep it as live as a Total Request
Then they ask me these questions
Like, ""How do you do it?
Press and the road and the music""
Truth is, I'm always up, I'm always down
Worry about everyone else

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good

I live life like my blood type, B positive
These days something got me feeling quite the opposite
Music like my heroin, but all I hear is poppy shit
Time to get up off of it and watch somebody copy it
I'm West bound down and out
Feeling fake now like somebody found me out
Need to slow down, I'm brownin' out
So many thoughts, lemme drown 'em out

Yeah, I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinkin'
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinkin'
Is anything forever or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?

Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good

I've been looking at where we're going
There's no slowin' down to go back
And thinking of where we've been
No one's ever been given a road map
Say ""Slow down, turn here, graduate and work here
Come and get a raise when you finish up your first year""
No, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
Keep it movin', now tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down
Don't worry about anyone else

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help

Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, ""Baby, please""
You ain't gonna freak with me, no more

Don't want you back, back, back, back

Don't want you back
Heey-heey
Heey-heey
Don't want you back
Heey-heey

You could never end a war with flowers
Decent love will overshadow hate
Our love has joined a new world, going better
Sick of burning candles in the rain

Little man, now can't you see?
I'm so done with you and me
Sick of living fantasies
It's not right, it's not life
You've been blind and so naive
You can't escape reality
You're not the man of my dreams tonight, no lie

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, ""Baby, please""
You ain't gonna freak with me, no more

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, ""Baby, please""
You ain't gonna freak with me, no more

All this toxic conversation
Every word has gone to waste
Is your bitter medication
Let me know how that taste
I come to a realization
You're just in love with the chase
Best believe you tried my patience
Ended up hands at stake

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, ""Baby, please""
You ain't gonna freak with me, no more

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, ""Baby, please""
You ain't gonna freak with me, no more"

Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can't find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healing
And I was runnin' out of luck
I never thought I'd find this feeling

I had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it

A little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it
A ménage à deux

Gave me déjà vu

Real in the summer
You can come and meet me
We can fall in love

Take me to the sea
Take me to the sun
Just a little secret
No one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous

To cool me down
You're my hidden treasure
On the shore

And baby, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
And you're on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
And you're on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you

Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
So I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you

My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

But I can see the irony
I'm humbled by the passing of time
I am brought down to my knees
An Arizona half and half
A half pack of cigarettes
A vacant lot, my tangled thoughts
Suburbia give me my God again

All the senses say
Nothing has changed
Soft lines from the streetlights fall the same on my face

Something massive happened here
I can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

The house still stands where it was built
I know 'cause I drove by tonight
A candle in the bedroom
Where I once performed a holy rite
And I did stop to hang my head
Just for a moment at the light
Cause now the altar is dead
And now you're just a friend that once was mine

Oh civilian, I lay low
How can you understand that there's a whole world gone wrong?

Something massive happened here
Can you feel it in the atmosphere?
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

How can I try to be civilized
When inside there is a shifting paradigm
And everything we built, we built on our love
Everything is spinning on the one assumption
How can I try to say sorry
When my words don't carry the same gravity
And everything I say, I say it knowing
Full well you still don't want to believe

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you

Singing the lines that weren't meant for me
No, I never wanted to go away
And with a heavy heart I come back to say
I'm another man, I'm another one
The feeling has gone, I know I'm no longer the one

(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
I don't know if I can, hold on
(Do you wanna? Do you wanna?)
Though I hold you again, I know I'm no longer that one

I realize what I'm throwing away
On a summer night I still hear you say
Standing there with your red coat on
""Where does a lover go when a love's undone?""
Well he went away and he'll go again
I can promise you all that you like when I hold your hand
Well I can't lie when I say I don't wait
No, so quit holding on, you know I'm no longer the one

I don't know if I can, hold on

The light on your face, up and into your room
Put on that light, come out of that shade
Don't need to know why, the bed unmade

And I'm turning away, I'm running down those stairs

And I'm out of your door, moving out of your place

Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night

I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
'Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left, drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play coy
I doubt he even knows
That it doesn't feel right

It started off with her hair
Guess every night has gotta start somewhere
Another badly combed frown
'Cause mirrors always seem to bring her down
Going through the motions of
Strangeways, Here We Come and teenage love
You see there's something inside
A voice that's telling her to stay behind
So as friends approached her
She looked over her shoulder and

She said, I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
'Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left, drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play coy
I doubt he even knows
That it doesn't feel right

Acting like he doesn't care
Oh but he's really the most self-aware
He'd cut his heart out to be cool
'Cause everybody loves a criminal
Knocking back a drink or two
She's on his mind and this he thinks is true
But ain't it funny that we're never
Certain of the way we are
Another youth wasted and eternally tainted

She said, I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
'Cause it doesn't feel right
So he left, drinking with the boys in convoy
Flirting with the girls who play coy
I doubt he even knows
That it doesn't feel right

She said, I don't wanna go out chasing
I kinda wanna go out dancing
Forget about the guys
'Cause it doesn't feel right

Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

Though It's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah

I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

And now we ran all those plans we've made

Something real I don't wanna fight
And I finally know every single night

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed

Hearing you whisper through the phone

And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
In the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion

Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm all right song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Now I've still got a lot of fight left in me"

Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

664,Lukas Graham,7 Years,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old"

But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side till the day I die

Till the day I die

Funny how we both end up free but everything seems all right
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more

666,Justin Bieber,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want

I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on, if time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

680,Twenty One Pilots,Car Radio,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me
Of who I killed
Inside my dream
I hate this car
That I'm driving
There's no hiding for me

I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence


I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence


And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence"
681,Arctic Monkeys,R U Mine?,"I'm a puppet on a string, Tracy Island
Time traveling diamond cutter shaped heartaches
That's come to find you, 4 in some velvet morning years too late
She's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
Through an open space in my mind
When she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I want to be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I want to hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
I keep imagining meeting
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I want to be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I want to hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken I just want to hear you say
""You've got me, baby are you mine?""

She's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
Through an open space in my mind
When she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I want to be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I want to hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)

I'd live for you and that's hard to do

Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you

Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'

Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket park
It might not get to see, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything is different, turned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the ore 'cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Rappin' bottles spin, I'm supplin' 10
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' 'round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'

Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'

Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she 'round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just side yelling you not that important
Waist shaper I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tarter, I'mma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough

688,Mike Posner,I Took A Pill In Ibiza - Seeb Remix,"I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said ""tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs"
689,Lukas Graham,Mama Said,"When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite all right
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we are good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on this stuff plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite all right
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids they started bugging me
But now they all standing right in front of me

When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite all right
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That's where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I'm always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said
You know what she told me

My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite all right
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama said that we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun

I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

A cup of coffee still steaming
Staring back at me, it's blacker than the night
I'm awake but still sleeping
I keep telling myself I'll be all right (I won't)
And I know it can't get worse than today
Sitting here and she's trying to rehearse what to say
See, she's in the bathroom hoping I'm not in earshot
While she's getting used to the sound of a teardrop (Splash)
It hits the tile
And I know it's been a while since you seen me
Smile and laugh like I used to
I've been in denial since it happened
Just take me to the past
'Cause I just can't imagine losing you (too)
I can't explain this so I'll keep it all inside
Wear my pain, but it's masked by my pride
She came to hold me and she cried
Told me this as she stared into my eyes, said

I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

I can't
You won't like what you see
If you were in my head and had to hear my pleas
It's like
I can't believe this is happening to me
And could someone please shut this fucking answering machine
So I can start leaving these messages
That you will never get
And all these cries for help
You'll never see and never check
But I guess it's easy for you to leave me
But believe me
See this isn't something that I'mma just forget
I would trade it all for one more minute
Don't you see I really need you to talk to
I'm still sitting here wondering who did it
While I'm staring out our front door
Knowing you'll never walk through
Said you'd come right back
And now you're gone like that
A blank stare as I stand so alone
And know you're never coming home (damn)

I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

I got a heart made of fool's gold
Got me feeling so cold
But you chipping away
All the promises that I told
Felt like I was on those
But keep slipping away
I want nobody else
But it's hard to get to know me
When I don't know myself
And it helps
'Cause I felt
I was down, I was out
Then you looked at me now
And said

I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave

And my crime is my sentence 
Repentance is taking commission 
It's taking a toll 
On my soul 
I'm screaming submission and, 
I don't know if I am dying or living 
'Cause I will save face 
For name's sake 
Abuse grace 
Take aim to obtain a new name 
And a newer place 
But my name is lame 
I can't walk and I ain't the same 
And my name became 
A new destiny to the grave 

And I, I can feel the pull begin 
Feel my conscience wearing thin 
And my skin, 
It will start to break up and fall apart 

I don't wanna fall, fall away 
I don't wanna fall, fall away 
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away"
699,Fall Out Boy,Uma Thurman,"I can move mountains

And I can’t get you out of my head

The stench, the stench, of summer sex
And CK eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-venom in me

Oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess

And I can’t get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night’s clothes and tomorrow’s dreams
But they’re not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

You’ll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You’ll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line

700,Alessia Cara,Wild Things,"To me, 'where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. It's a place of liberty and shamelessness. It can take a split second of our lifetime to find it, but once you do you'll be free.

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

There's a wild thing that exists in all of us, it lives in our passions and the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs... It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... We have to become it."
701,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
And for always I will say

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free"

704,Daya,Hide Away,"Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother (Hey!)
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
He's gonna save my life like Superman
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know

705,Alessia Cara,Here,"(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here (oh oh, oh oh)"

My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city 
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
And let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me
'Cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on)

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me

We want it all

That you all have guns

Simply suggest my chest

""Love me, love me""
That's all I ask for
""Love me, love me""

He battered his tiny fists to feel something
Wondered what it's like to touch and feel something

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the windows

That night he caged her
Bruised and broke her
He struggled closer
Then he stole her

Violet wrists and then her ankles, silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the windows
I will hear their voices
I'm a glass child
I am Hannah's regrets

Monster, how should I feel?
Turn the sheets down
Murder ears with pillow lace
There's bath tubs full of glow flies
Bathed in kerosene
Their words tattooed in his veins"

Someone is out there, that we truly trust
There is a rainbow, for you and me
A beautiful sunrise, eternally

But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

We were reaching, reaching for the rafters

And on most of the days we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised
Yeah, 'cause we were done
I remember, we were sleeping in cars
We were searching for OZ
We were burning cigars
With white plastics tips till we saw the sun
And we said crazy things like

I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew till we had to go
And we were saying things like

I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

To the way you move

Everybody here is watching you

You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were

It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

Of when we were young

Is gonna bring us to our knees

Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you

To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go

Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

And all the other girls wanna wear expensive things, and diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

You get off on a 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo

Then Snow White
She did it right in her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for

The only thing that a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be, because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

You get off on a 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be, 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Sure I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still
I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But no, I won't sit still, look pretty

Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

You get off on a 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

You get off on a 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty

Know we're good enough

From your roommate back in Boulder

I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-One Eighty-Two song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay?

And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Oh, don't double charge for me for that
Oh, don't double charge for me, we like
Oh, don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Verse the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'mma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed"

You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up...

Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said 'drink from me, drink from me'
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low

Got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high

To make the stars come out

751,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

What we supposed to do with all his friends around, yeah
Smoking weed, he'd never wanna leave the house
Got an empty cushion on that sofa now

Told him good luck with the next one
Maybe she'll be just as immature
Gotta thank him, he's the reason
That I'll find out what I'm looking for

Why so loud?
If you don't like my sound
You can turn it down
I got a road
And I'm walking alone
Uphill battle
I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious
I get braggadocios
I'm not gonna stop
I like the view from the top

You talk that blah blah
That la la, that rah rah shit
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with this

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter, don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I leave you behind

Gone in a flash
And I ain't leaving like that

They talk that blah blah
That la la, that rah rah shit
Go with the punches, and take the hits
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with this

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete

The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

763,Ed Sheeran,Castle on the Hill,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Any phone I ever own, she call it
She call me at 2, call me at 3
Check I'm a wakkeboi, fukk I gon' be
Wanna grab an eight ball, set your nigga free
Then she walk with a nose bleed on her blue jeans
Dumb bitch, dumb hoe
Don't call my phone, go home
We jettin' out till we made it
Shut the fuck up complainin'

Nails scratchin' my back tatt

And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss

Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion

And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever

Staring at the wall
Open up my window
Head floats out the door

No one else around
The shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head
Blinded by the sky

Feel my weight in front
Following the sound
Moves away so fast
Fall down to the ground

I know there's more to come
Jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me
Chasing down the street

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

I'm in love with a shooting star 
But she moves so fast 
When she falls then
I'll be waiting

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

I'm in love with a shooting star

Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we call against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by

Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side

777,Disturbed,The Sound Of Silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells, of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Céilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"

Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold

Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one's listening
I nervously rehearsed for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed

And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows, knows, knows. No one knows, knows, knows

You set the other on fire. You set the other on fire"

Drive highways and byways to be there with you

In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

Into you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

You get under my skin
More than anyone's ever been
But when we lay in bed
You hold me hard 'til I forget

That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
We scream and we shout
And make up the same day, same day

Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
Into you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns

Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
Into you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more"

802,Martin Garrix;Bebe Rexha,In the Name of Love,"If I told you this was only gonna hurt
If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn
Would you walk in? Would you let me do it first?
Do it all in the name of love
Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?
In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love?

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of love
In the name, name
In the name of
In the name, name
In the name of
In the name, name
In the name of
Love

If I told you we could bathe in all the lights
Would you rise up, come and meet me in the sky?
Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?
Would you fall in the name of love?
When there's madness, when there's poison in your head
When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
And it's all in the name of love

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of love
In the name, name
In the name of

I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love

In the name of love, name of love

804,Miley Cyrus,Malibu,"I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I try to smile
Hoping I just stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"

But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog, yeah-yeah-yeah
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball, yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah-yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky

Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby they could see it in my eyes

807,Taylor Swift,Out Of The Woods,"Looking at it now
It all seemed so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world is black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
On the night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided
We decided to move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

(Are we out of the woods?)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
And you started crying, baby I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
But when the sun came up, you were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
I remember
Oh I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

808,Taylor Swift,Blank Space,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

Always somebody
You're willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting

Wanna leave my own life behind

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

To get you out of my head

So when I call you in the middle of the night

I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night

I need you
In the middle of the night

I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

Yeah and I don't understand

To forget you again

If they keep tellin' you where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

Now I can't stand to be alone

My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you going
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and I happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I've been thrown out, I've been burned
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name

You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying"

Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf

Might be over now, but I feel it still

Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Leave her with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies

We could wave until the walls come down
(Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little tip
Kids in the middle, move over till it falls
Don't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
Who looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited

It rained down, like

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on

867,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song

I got a new attitude and a lease on life 
And some peace of mind
You seek and I find, I can sleep when I die 
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit, I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?

I heard you die twice
Once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time
That somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth
Did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people
Or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus
Searching for euphoria
Trudgin' through the mud to find the present, no ignorin' us
Got twenty thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors 
My mama told me, ""Never bow your head"" (Woo)

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now, I see the sunrise

They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone 
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smilin' down on me like, ""Woo, that boy got bars!"" 
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith, and I remember why I came, woo!

Dear life, I'm holding on (ahh)
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone (ahh)

You drove your Rolls into the swamp
You stole away like a thief, reeling from the sticker shock
Of the price they put upon your soul
You buy it back from the burning ashes of the devil you know

Dear life, I'm holding on
Dear life, I'm holding on (ahh)
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone (ahh)

Dear life, come and pick me up
Dear life, I think the button's stuck
Dear life, I think it's gone too far
Dear life, please lower the bar
Lower than the stars

Dear life, I'm holding on
Dear life, I'm holding on (ahh)
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone (ahh)"
895,The Script;Nicky Jam,Rain (feat. Nicky Jam) - Saga WhiteBlack Remix,"Woke up this morning, can't shake the thunder from last night
You left with no warning and took the summer from my life
I gave you my everything, now my world it don't seem right
Can we just go back to being us again?

'Cause when I'm sitting in the bar
All the lovers with umbrellas always pass me by
It's like I'm living in the dark
And my heart's turned cold since you left my life
And no matter where I go
Girl, I know if I'm alone, there ain't no blue sky
I don't know what I'm doing wrong

'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain, rain, rain down on me
Each drop is pain, pain, pain when you leave
It's such a shame we fucked it up, you and me
'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain

And it feels like
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And it feels like
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain

Yeah
I tried to find shelter here in the arms of someone new
But I'd rather be there under the covers just with you, ooh
'Cause you were my everything, now I don't know what to do
Oh, I'm caught up in the storm

'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain, rain, rain down on me
Each drop is pain, pain, pain when you leave
It's such a shame we fucked it up, you and me
'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain

And it feels like
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And it feels like
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain

'Cause when I'm sitting in the bar
All the lovers with umbrellas always pass me by
It's like I'm living in the dark
And my heart's turned cold since you left my life
And no matter where I go
Well, I know if I'm alone, there'll be no blue sky
I don't know what I'm doing wrong

Baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain, rain, rain down on me
Each drop is pain, pain, pain when you leave
It's such a shame we fucked it up, you and me
'Cause baby, when you're gone
All it does is rain

And it feels like
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Nothin' that a little love can't fix
There ain't no kinda situation
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you
FBI interrogation
I would get up there and lie for you

When push come to shove

When push come to shove, aye

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down

I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you

It's just like Bonnie and Clyde just walked in
A gangster and his bride just walked in
We on the same team and we ballin'
Got me showin' off my ring like I'm Jordan
And I'ma hold you down like you hold me
And I'll never tell a soul what you told me
When I was sittin' in the cells is when you showed me
It takes a real one to put up with the old me
That's why you in the coupe with the low seat
That's why we at the game on the floor seats
My diamond that they seein' from the nosebleeds
You make 'em mad, feel like you won a trophy

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (love you down)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (down, down, down)
Long as you're holding me down, down, down (I'm gon' love you down)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (long as you're lovin' me, boy)

912,Justin Timberlake,"CAN'T STOP THE FEELING! (Original Song from DreamWorks Animation's ""TROLLS"")","I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

920,Ed Sheeran,Castle on the Hill,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

All these crazy thoughts in my mind now (Travie: There's just something 'bout you)

You got the lock, I got the key
You know the rest, you know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees

You got me wrapped up around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so high I can't come down (Travie: You got me wrapped up baby)

I don't ever wanna give up
All this spell you got me under
I see fireworks when we touch now (Travie:There's just something 'bout you)

Let them say whatever they want
It's too late 'cause you're in my blood now (Travie:There's just something 'bout you)

Make me wanna reapply to school for the hell of it
I'll be the student, you be the teacher
Miss Sophisticated, such a pleasure to meet ya
Yeah, but here's the only issue
Since we met, you kinda turned my world upside down
And I don't really mind Spiderman kissing you
As long as you're planning on sticking around
The happiest boy in the world award goes to me
Not a chance, nobody came close to 'em
I kinda knew you was troublesome 
You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum

Everything that you do
Every way that you move
There's just something 'bout you (Travie:There's just something 'bout you)
Everything that you do

Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties

Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
It's important to you is not important to me
Way down by the edge of your reasons

Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list

And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit

But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead

Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star

""I need to get myself away from this place""

948,Third Eye Blind,Semi-Charmed Life,"I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again and I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive

Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the place we used to start

I want something else"

Debbie just hit the wall
She never had it all
One Prozac a day
Husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door
When she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV
Is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright

Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she still preoccupied
With 19- 19- 1985

Woohoo-hoo
(1985)
Woohoo-hoo

She's seen all the classics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even St. Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham!
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
What ever happened to sitcoms, game shows
On the radio were

And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she still preoccupied

When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop
Stop, stop!
And bring back...

A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought

958,Passion Pit,Take a Walk,"All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed awhile
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year, I'll see them
For a week or so at most

I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)
I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)

Practice isn't perfect but the market cuts the loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called
To say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn

I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)
I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)

Honey, it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much 
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front 
And tonight I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young 

And tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids 
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes 
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees 
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)
I took a walk

If I call you on the phone

But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
And you're on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you

Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
So I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too"

Holding on the memories
Cause smiles are still alive
Looking to the future and there's happiness in sight

Blow the smoke right through the window""

Yet even though it's been so long, it still hurts just the same

We're turning, the world is turning around
You know I'm on your side
Gonna hold you up when the waves collide
Cause on the darkest night

Yeah, we can turn it around
Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, yeah, we can turn it around

Is the love lost between the sheets
With the memory of what used to be?
Take me now, take me all the way to the highest heights
We can make it right now

Does it have to be perfect?
What the hell are we doing?
Maybe we can get through this

When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed

So take my hand, don't let go

I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

'Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting

See my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant
So you try to fill it in

But love, pray for me

Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be

Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (burn up)
Mama too hot like a (like what?)
Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace)
I got a hundred G's in my Goyard (G's)
My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle
While I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Riccardo
She havin' it
When they call her workin' on The Bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (I might)

I might empty my bank account (ooh)
And buy that boy with a pipe (ooh, yeah)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might (slide)
Empty my bank account (ooh, slide)
And buy that boy with a pipe (slide, yeah)
(Do you slide on all your nights like this?)
Buy that boy with a pipe

Through the heart, yeah, you went right in
I fell for every word you said
I come here but I can't stay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why some things have to be this way

We build it up, build it up to break it down
And then we're lost until we're found
And when we're high further from the crown
If all is fair in love and war
I can't do this anymore
If all is fair in love and war
I can't do this anymore

So unfair, so unfair, so unfair to me
So unfair, so unfair, so unfair to me

You told me from the start
Nothing could tear us apart
Now when I look I see a stranger
I come here but I can't stay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why some things have to end this way

We're supposed to stay the night but
Changed their mind and called their mommy
You are not me

Remember that day
We met for coffee and you were late
Yeah we shat all about you and you mostly
But a bit about me
And then now we back to yours
And I never been there before
On the blue line subway
Yeah I think it was raining
Yeah you made me a painting
Sing a song about dolphins
Young love, was calling

It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
But it is long gone now
When all the stars fell down
It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
That day you broke my heart
I loved you way too hard
Now I'm free

Remember so well
That time when I found a dog
I thought you'd be cool
Not cool at all
When you opened the door (come on)
You said I was your soulmate
And I was there on my way
On the blue line subway
And I think it was snowing
'Cause the city was glowing
Yeah I started to notice
Young love, was broken

It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
But it is long gone now
When all the stars fell down
It was a good day
Oh, what a good day
That day you broke my heart
I loved you way too hard

I wanna feel you, I can't leave without you tonight, ooh
I don't want nothing if I can't be with you tonight, ooh
I can't feel your love in the morning when I wake up feeling cold inside
And I can't stop myself from falling when we do the same things every night

Look what you started, look what you done
There's nowhere to turn, nowhere to run
Just friends in the dark is all that are
But when the lights go on, we fake love

I wanna feel you, I can't leave without you tonight, ooh
I don't want nothing if I can't be with you tonight, ooh

But I can't leave
We are, we are imagined ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory

Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory

We are, we are in love enemies
We are sentimental slaves on broken knees
We're on empty
We were, we were one identity
Now the trouble is remembering
Addicted to a memory"

Got caught up in my own selfishness

And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I arrive
I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance

Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
Till I can't feel my heart

And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'll do all I can
To get you out of my head

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

Yeah and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
To forget you again

So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night

Can't you see
You bitches can't do it like me
Motherfuckers stay mad
Like I killed the mom or something
If you really didn't care
You'd let it be

I've been dying since day one
But y'all knew that
My dick is like Americans
Too fat, but dangerous
I'm the grimiest motherfucker to walk this earth
The shit I do is way below dirty sewers, a connoisseur
I'm a flying reptile
A pterodactyl on Adderall
I've got a bunch of scales that I dug up
You've never heard at all
Eat a dick little faggot, jeez
And furthermore
You trying to scrap with me
I don't beef, faggot
I'm herbivore
Hmm
I crawled into the industry
A saturated circus
Manipulating like Hillary
They say I'm crazy
But lately they've been defending me
Because take a look around, motherfucker
Everyone's digging me

I live in a constant state of fear and misery
Do you miss me anymore?
And I don't even notice
When it hurts anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Pussy, pussy, pussy
Can't you read
I'm a dirty old pussy eating freak
Motherfuckers still mad
Like I killed the mom or something
If you really didn't care
You'd let me eat

Here we go again
I'll make jokes about your estrogen
That's pretty much the rest of this song
I'm roasting everything
I'm a weird little entity
That'll enter titties
And bust all over the tummy and little nippies
(Ew!)
I know I'm morbid at times
That's how I like to be
They call my dick a mammoth
You're salty you got a micro-d
Classic penis joke
Inserted with appropriate timing
Because if I ain't got a penis line
I ain't dining
No homo, but seriously I'm getting faded
And my life is like my vids
Low budget and underrated
Kids, the only way to succeed
Is to chip away at the soul
And hope by the time you get there
You ain't singin'

I live in a constant state of fear and misery
Do you miss me anymore?
And I don't even notice
When it hurts anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

You're way too tired to stay awake with me.
You are the one thing that I'm afraid I can't keep.
And I remember how it used to be... When I would still appear in your dreams... Now you're not even holding me... I guess this darkness is all you see.

Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

Up, all night

Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No not tonight
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your side

Scattered hearts, broken glass
I don't feel a thing (do, do)

When you're next to me (do, do)

Tear it up, tear it down

'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that is how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay as long as I'm with you
I'll be up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

I'm never gonna find my way
If I don't run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there are things I can't control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth I've been trying to hide
I've been waiting for you way too long
Won't you come and take me home
Oh I, I'm praying this ain't all a dream
Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

I been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
All night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming
Wide awake, that's okay as long as I'm with you

I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

I found peace in your violence

Smoking weed and writing songs

Meet me at the sunrise, at the sunrise
I can get you so high, so high
Burning up the daylight, in the daylight
Meet me at the sunrise, sunrise

Call my name
'Cause I'm so lost and I don't know this place
And I got this feeling that I just can't shake
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you

So lost in your crystal light

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love

We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours

And smoke them hoes down till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin' grade A

(Snoop Dogg - Verse 2)
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase

Chevy, its gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like ""Khalifa put the weed in a J""

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

(Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg - Verse 3)
And I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Flowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, hi it's me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

(Wiz Khalifa - Bridge)
Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free"

Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Everytime you walk by?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (all around)

1215,Angus & Julia Stone,Paper Aeroplane,"I spilled the ink across the page
Trying to spell your name
So I fold it up and I flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It won't fly the seven seas to you
Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands of someone else
The garbage man

Got to say mmm mmm mmm x2

So he opens it up and reads it out to all his friends
Amongst the crowd a heart will break and a heart will mend
He walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his hand
He reaches out only to catch the sky
Its gone with the wind

Got to say mmm mmm mmm x2

I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down there it goes
Paper aeroplane
It hasn't flown the seven seas to you
But it's on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone else
To find you girl

Got to say mmm"

Shaggy: Man...
Rikrok: I don't know what to do.
Shaggy: Say it wasn't you.
Rikrok: Alright...

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you fi grant the woman access to your villa
Trespass and a witness while you up in a your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you're caught up inna

To be a true player, you fi know how fi play
If she say a night, convince her, say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, ""Baby, no way""

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me when
I told her it wasn't me?

Make sure knows she nuh she really on a right fi vex
A never you she see a make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seeing is believing, so you better change your specs

You know she a go bring up all of the things up from the past
All the little evidence you better know fi mask
Quick pon your answer, know how fi talk
But if she back a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)

Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason, it makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost

'Cause I say
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
Be someone

And put on my best suit

Yeah, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die

Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway

Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family

Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
I can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be boys
Standing at that altar

Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die

While wilted roses filled the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show

This is fading, but the band plays on now
We're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down

No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines we read so perfectly

I said don't worry I'm timeless
Watching Toy Story 3 that's a great fucking movie

Celebrating these life goals

Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain't turning these beats down

Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I'd be right there with ya
But I'm committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don't get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I'm sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I'll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone

Grabbing the keys and I'm fresh out the door

You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it's gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain't the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it's Macklemore and Lil Boat

And shit, I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?

I heard you die twice
Once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time
That somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth
Did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people
Or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus
Searching for euphoria
Trudgin' through the mud to find the present, no ignorin' us
Got twenty thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors 
My mama told me, ""Never bow your head"" (Woo)

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now, I see the sunrise 
Now I feel glorious, glorious 
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh, yes it is)
You know that we been goin' in (Been goin' in)
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win) 
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone 
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smilin' down on me like, ""Woo, that boy got bars!"" 
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith, and I remember why I came, woo!

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night And now, I see the sunrise
And now, I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine 
We're planting our flag, they don't understand 
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine 
We're planting our flag, they don't understand

It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now

When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite all right to hate me now

The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to... meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy

Can't you see that its just raining
Ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see?
You gotta wake up slow"

I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dream come true, yeah, yeah, yeah (for once in my life)

For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (not like it's hurt before)
For once I have something
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
(Someone who needs me) A-heh, heh, hey yeah
(Someone who needs me) Oh, I'm in love baby

You've got to make the morning last
Just kickin' down the cobble stones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da-da da da, feelin' groovy

Hello lamppost, what'cha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
Do-in do do, feelin' groovy
Ba da-da-da da da, feelin' groovy

I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning-time drop all its petals on me
Life I love you, all is groovy"

Talkin' 'bout my girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me

Talkin' 'bout my girl

1256,Matt Nathanson,Come On Get Higher,"I miss the sound of your voice
And I miss the rush of your skin
And I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
Make you believe
Make you forget

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet, perfect words that you said

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
Make you believe
And make you forget

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

I miss the pull of your heart
I can taste the sparks on your tongue
And I see angels and devils and God when you come on
Hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on...

Sing sha la la la
Sing sha la la la la
Hoo hoo hoo

Come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

Come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me
Drown me in love

It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all wrong, it's so right

Come on get higher
Come on and get higher
Because everything works, love
Because everything works in your arms"
1257,John Mayer,Your Body Is a Wonderland,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland"

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short

Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank till I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and fan

Well, okay I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well, okay I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in between
Well, okay we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?"
1272,Gary Portnoy,Where Everybody Knows Your Name (Cheers Theme),"Making your way in the world today
Takes everything you've got
Taking a break from all your worries
Sure would help a lot
Wouldn't you like to get away?

All those nights when you've got no lights
The check is in the mail
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by its tail
And your third fiance didn't show

Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
You want to be where you can see
Our troubles are all the same
You want to be where everybody knows your name

Climbing the walls when no one calls
You've lost at love again
And the more you're down and out
The more you need a friend
When you long to hear a kind hello

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead
The morning's looking bright (morning's looking bright)
And your shrink ran off to Europe
And didn't even write
And your husband wants to be a girl

Be glad there's one place in the world
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
You want to go where people know
People are all the same
You want to go where everybody knows your name

Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
Where everybody knows your name"

How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love, uh

Come on, come on, turn a little faster
Come on, come on, the world will follow after
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love

So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming
All this love melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love

Well, baby, I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end-er all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love, uh

These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Come on, come on, move a little closer
Come on, come on, I wanna hear you whisper
Come on, come on, settle down inside my love

Uh, come on, come on, (Come on) jump a little higher
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on, (Come on) we were once upon a time in love

You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight?

Still I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
And are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight?"

Well something on the surface it stinks

I said something on the surface 
Well it kind of makes me nervous
To say that you deserve this 
And what kind of God would serve this 
We will cure this dirty old disease 
Well if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 

The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end 

I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away

Well I heard two men, talking on the radio 
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
Or they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the

Be right back after this 
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh death-breath 
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe 
Dance with me 
'Cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 

The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end 

I won't worry my life away 
I won't worry my life away 

When I fall in love
I take my time, there's no need to hurry 
When I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still going to shine 
And I'll tell you why

Because the remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend

The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When, it all amounts to nothing

1278,Joni Mitchell,You Turn Me On I'm A Radio,"If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
Oh honey you turn me on
I'm a radio
I'm a country station
I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower
Waving for you
I'm a broadcasting tower
Waving for you
And I'm sending you out
This signal here
I hope you can pick it up
Loud and clear
I know you don't like weak women
You get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women
'Cause they're hip to your tricks
It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line
But you know I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind
But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey
Who needs the static
It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal
From ""Breakfast Barney""
To the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now
If you're still listening there
If you're driving into town 
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach
With the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies honey
The love's still flowing
If your head says forget it
But your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station
The lines are open"
1279,Bruce Springsteen,Thunder Road,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison's singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again

Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?

Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busted open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real, to trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks

Oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road

Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight
Take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
Tonight we'll be free, all the promises will be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet

And in the lonely cool before dawn, you hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind
So Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win"

To get myself together and go on from here

Whatever it takes to make it I'm going all the way

It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain

We'll get up and start again

From the shadows, lifted
Oh we could be, lifted up today
Lifted all the way, you and I forever

It's undisturbable the peace we found
In a bright new space up above the clouds
Everything is understandable
You don't have to say anything too loud

When all our luck runs out again
We're brought back down to solid ground
I wouldn't say I'm mad about the rain
But we'll get through it anyway
We'll get back to the start again

The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna

Beer bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Mambo Number 5!

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doing it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

1297,Stars,Hold On When You Get Love and Let Go When You Give It,"There's been a lot of talk of love
But that don't amount to nothing
You can evolve the stars above
But that doesn't make it something

And the only way to last
And the only way to live it
Is to hold on when you get love,
And let go when you give it... give it.

It's a pretty melody
It might help you through the night time
But it doesn't make it easy
To leave the party at the right time

If I'm frightened, if I'm high
It's my weakness please forgive it
At least I hold on when I get love,
And I let go when I give it

What do I do when I get lonely?
What do I do?
Hold on when you get love,
What do I do when I get lonely?
What do I do?
Let go when you give it
What do I do?

The world won't listen to this song
And the radio won't play it
But if you like it sing along
Sing 'cause you don't know how to say it

Take the weakest thing in you
And then beat the bastards with it
And always hold on when you get love,
So you can let go when you give it

Take the weakest thing in you
And then beat the bastards with it
And always hold on when you get love,
So you can let go when you give it... give it... give it.

What do I do when I get lonely?
What do I do?
Hold on when you get love,
What do I do when I get lonely?
What do I do?
And let go when you give love
What do I do when I get lonely?
What do I do?
Hold on when you get love,
What do I do?

I know it's true, please don't think I do
Nothing that you say or do will make you love me
Forget the song, things will go on
I keep seeing you from the dark with you above me

I know it's true, please don't think I do
Nothing that you say or do will make you love me
Forget the song, things will go on
I keep seeing you from the dark with you above me

Take the weakest thing in you
And then beat the bastards with it
And always hold on when you get love,
So you can let go when you give it.
Give it... give it... give it... give it... give it... give it."
1298,Passion Pit,Take a Walk,"All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed awhile
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year, I'll see them
For a week or so at most

I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)
I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)

Practice isn't perfect but the market cuts the loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called
To say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn

I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)
I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)

Honey, it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much 
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front 
And tonight I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young 

And tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids 
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes 
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees 
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)
I took a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, oh)"

We tore up the walls, we slept on couches
We lifted this house, we lifted this house
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south

I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine

Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling 'round the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all I want
Now it's all I want
Live my life without
Coming up for air
Now it's all I want
I want everyone
Racing down the hill
I am faster than you
Wait for summertime
Wait for summertime

It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you

Emitting all its graces through the pores

Will you wonder 
Now I'm gone never here 
When you look nothing near 
And I wonder I wonder 

Rolling through the rocky bend 
Will the journey ever end 
Try'na find the missing puzzle under 
Thunderclouds and desert streets 
When you fly a lonely sky the view is far too sweet 
I'm like a bird I sing from hurt 
Spread your wings and glide to me 

Time to wander 
Now I'm gone never here 
When you look nothing near 
Will you wonder 
Now I'm gone never here 
When you look nothing near 
And I wonder I wonder

Walk out the door

But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody"
1319,Gotye,Eyes Wide Open,"With our eyes wide open we...
With our eyes wide open we...

So this is the end of the story
Everything we had, everything we did
Is buried in dust
And this dust is all that's left of us

But only a few ever worried

Though the signs were clear, they had no idea
You just get used to living in fear
Or give up
When you can't even picture your future

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open...

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)

Some people offered up answers
We made out like we heard, they were only words
They didn't add up
To a change in the way we were living it

And the saddest thing
Is all of it could have been avoided

But it was like to stop consuming's to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't?
We're all in the same boat, staying afloat
For the moment

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
Mmm hmmm mmm

With our eyes wide open we
Walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open we
Walk the plank, we walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open we
Walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open we...
And that was the end of the story"

There are things in my life I can't control

I don't even know what love is

Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named

You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...

Remind me to spend some good time with you

I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try...

No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost

When it's all over I'll let you know"
1339,Phoenix,Too young,"Baby when I saw you turning at the end of the street
I knew a time was gone and it took me like ages
Just to understand that I was afraid to be a simple guy
I tried my best to smile but deep inside my heart
I felt it was shouting like a crowd dancing
I guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it is

Can't you hear it calling oh yeah
Everybody's dancin' oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young

I can't lie on my bed without thinking I was wrong
But when that feeling calls this world becomes another
Nighttime won't hold me in your arms again
I got a very good friend who says he can't believe the love I give
Is not enough to end your fears
I guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it is

Can't you hear it calling oh yeah
Everybody's shakin' oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young

Oh rainfalls and hard times coming they won't leave me tonight
I wish I knew what I was doing
Just to let this spirit survive
Everybody's dancing oh yeah
I guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it is

Can't you hear it calling oh yeah
Everybody's dancing oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young"
1340,The Shins,Simple Song,"Well, this is just a simple song
To say what you done
I told you 'bout all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun

When I was just nine years old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest

I know that things can really get rough
When you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough
To play like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives so critical
As this little home

My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift
When you tell me with your tongue
And your breath goes in my lungs
And we float over the rift

I know that things can really get rough
When you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough
To play like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives so critical
As this little home

Well, this would be a simple song
To say what you done
I told you 'bout all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun

Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the act struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew"
1341,The Shins,Australia,"""Time to put the earphones on!""
""No!""

Born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies
All you want's one more Saturday
But look here until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
'Til the day

They come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes

You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried

A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep them folded in your lap
And raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Just the same

Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late?
Or changed by a potion
And find a handsome young mate for you to love?

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Well do it now or grow old
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold

Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this is so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary

Dare to be one of us, girl
Facing the android's conundrum
I felt like I should just cry

But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
You're Himmler in your coat
You don't know how long I have been
Watching the lantern dim
Starved of oxygen
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window"
1342,The Shins,Caring Is Creepy,"I think I'll go home and mull this over
Before I cram it down my throat
At long last it's crashed, its colossal mass
Has broken up into bits in my moat

Rip the mattress off the floor
Walk the cramps off, go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin, hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines seeking shade

Far above our heads
Are the icy heights that contain all reason

It's a luscious mix of words and tricks
That let us bet when you know we should've fold
On rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
And of the whole mess of roads we're now on

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how I got so old just wondering how
Never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond
My remote concern of being condescending
All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how I got so old just wondering how
Never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond
My remote concern of being condescending
All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks"
1343,The Postal Service,Sleepin In,-1
1344,The Postal Service,Such Great Heights,"I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God Himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now"" but we'll stay

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine but the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You'll hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now"" but we'll stay

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now"" but we'll stay

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now""
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now"""

How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now
When two people become one?
I can feel it
When two people become one

Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minutes working overtime

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now
When two people become one?
I can feel it
When two people become one

Is it real now
When two people become one?
I can feel it
When two people become one

Catch me, I'm falling down
Catch me, I'm falling down

Don't stop, just keep going on
I'm your shoulder lean upon
So come on, deliver from inside
All we got is tonight that is right till first light

Is it real now
When two people become one?
I can feel it
When two people become one

Is it real now
When two people become one?
I can feel it

1347,Empire of the Sun,Standing On The Shore,"Standing on the shore
Waiting for the ship in call
There's something in the way I move that keeps them on their own

The stars explodes a storm
A billion seasons born
A shock to the waves I know, breaking far from shore

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk

The future's in my hands
I hold it in my palms
Engrave it the leylines running right down her arms

Speak in silent tongues
Lies reflect the times
The ghosts and the shadows fill the living scene

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk

Don't want to talk

Don't want to talk

Swimming in December
Heading for the city lights
In nineteen seventy five

We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon
Drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life

For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven
Got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try

Lie in the sand and visualize
Like it's seventy five again

A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it

You man the island and the cocaine, and the elegant cars

This is our decision to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend, to pretend
We're fated to pretend, to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend, to pretend
We're fated to pretend, to pretend

Am I free or am I tied up?

I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

Listen, I'm your friend (don't quote me)
But not a friend worth noting
Yes please don't ever note me as your friend

Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene, oho

I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head

All European, once again with feeling
Higher education making a sense

Justify your thesis certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense

Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can

And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho

I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want
'Cause no one's really watching
Well she'll have something to say about it but
We all have problems
We're all having problem
And we've all got something to say

I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head"
1367,Passion Pit,Little Secrets,"When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook 'em up, the walls came crumbling
My thin skin trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb

Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

It's the way I see
Everything I need
Its no way to be

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up we keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

My face blew up at such a casual sight
The spattered colors of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen

Oh have you ever felt so goddamned strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains

Watch the basin drain
As your lifelines wanes
And you can't explain
As your friends complain

You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your poor family's name

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up we keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

Mother I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Staring at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up we keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher"
1368,Passion Pit,The Reeling,"Wikipedia has an article on
The Reeling
We dug these holes we crawled into, now they're my home
Now here I can not feel the wind, can't feel the rain or cold
And I believe in gentle harmony
Oh how I loathe all this obscenity
Is this the way my life has got to be?
Have I a single opportunity?

Look at me, oh look at me, is this the way I'll always be?
Oh no, oh no
Now I pray that somebody will swiftly come and kidnap me
Oh no, oh no
Everyday I lie awake and pray to god today's the day
Oh no, oh no
Here I am, oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?
Oh no, oh no

And all at once I feel this, oh how it clings to me
It reels and calls me towards some confounding destiny
And I can feel the madness inch by inch
The more I run the more I am convinced
I've colored all these like the branches twist
Just like we settle in the frothy mist

Look at me, oh look at me, is this the way I'll always be?
Oh no, oh no
Now I pray that somebody will swiftly come and kidnap me
Oh no, oh no
Everyday I lie awake and pray to god today's the day
Oh no, oh no
Here I am, oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?
Oh no, oh no

Look at me, oh look at me, is this the way I'll always be?

Oh no, oh no"
1369,Passion Pit,Eyes As Candles,"My world astir and sickly
Spits out our voices singing
""Tra la la la,"" on high now
To kingdom come so slightly
Herein a void in your place
I twitch and tweak in allusion
To sit and stare so blankly
Until all hope is used up

Why do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done, what have I lost that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?

Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey

In some dark room
A smoky figure fills me full
Makes my head swell in ruin
My family kneels at their pew
They nod, ""We believe in what you're doing""
I feel it rise above me
The western landscapes towering
And from my shell of a body
The flowers blossom for picking

Why do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done, what have I lost that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?

Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey
Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey

I've waited and waited for someone to take it
Don't fight it don't bother, an inch for another
Don't listen, don't hear them, they're in this together
I've learned well now hear me, there's much to be fearing
I'm used to your absence, your faceless distractions

Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey (in background until end)

I've painted your patterns but found them attractive
Now I've been leaning toward a life far more candid
Though lead through the dark with your eyes as my candles
Where you're life and my life's directions can wrangle

And all of a sudden you've left me to handle
The reasons that never forbid me to stand tall
And somehow or somewhere I found out the secret
To staying alive without actually breathing"
1370,Passion Pit,Swimming In The Flood,"My eyes
Have once again been proven wrong
Your clouds
Your blanket and my pity song

Hovering on your front lawn
Carry on until it's gone

But, what can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch
But the water's rising up

Then I lie
Naked in a rampage
In the flesh
Face to face with the onset
I forget
Everything that's ever made me
Rise again
Now slowly leave my memory

But, what can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch
But the water's rising up
Now all my lovers raise their cups

But, what can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?

1372,Passion Pit,Moth's Wings,"Dear friend, as you know
Your flowers are withering 
Your mother's gone missing
Your leaves have drifted away

But the clouds are clearing up
And I've come reveling
Burning incandescently
Like a bastard on the burning sea

You're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyways?
Put down your sword and crown 
Come lay with me on the ground

You come beating like moth's wings
Spastic and violently
Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core
But you run away from me
And you've left me shimmering
Like diamond wedding rings
Spinning dizzily down on the floor

You're just like your father
Buried deep under the water 
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyways?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground. (x2)"
1373,Passion Pit,Folds In Your Hands,"Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I'm fine
I'll be fine until the morning comes
Then unmask me in the blistering sun

Oh let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go
Or I'll
Burst in front of your eyes
Then collect myself from the ground

And when I go
And when I go
Just let me go
Like a light
Flickering out in the skies
Lost as fast as was found

Everything's easy when you've never had to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you till you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you

Lay low
Don't let me know when it's real
Will they quietly follow me here?
Will they take me as their own?
Now I will hold you I will keep you I'll control my love
Until it folds in my hands
But I'll build it back to the top

Everything's easy when you've never had to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you till you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you

How I climbed your city's walls?

I was a fool for love

1376,Tegan and Sara,Drove Me Wild,"When I think of you
I think of your skin
Golden brown from the sun
Your arms outstretched
Your hair cut shorter than it'd been
But still blowing in the wind

When I picture you
I think of your smile
And it drives me wild
Your laugh escaping you
Your head thrown to the side
And it drives me wild

You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us
You clung to self restraint, you followed the plan
You put the brakes on this

And it drove me
And it drove me
And it drove me wild

When I envision you
I think of your sheets
Tangled up beneath me
Your body inching close
Closer to the edge
I got a hold of you then

When I imagine you
I think of that room
And it drives me wild
Your face relaxed
Your voice a whisper in my ear
And it drives me wild

You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us
You clung to self restraint, you followed the plan
You put the brakes on this

And it drove me
And it drove me
And it drove me wild

And it drove me
And it drove me
And it drove me wild

I woulda had us
Swervin' through those streets
Over and over
I woulda stalled
Or rushed us through those greens
Over and over

But you knew that
(You drove me wild)
And you wouldn't let me lose control
(You drove me wild)
Control

You carried romance in the palm of your hand

If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light

Like ships in the night letting cannon balls fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fist fly from my mouth as it turns south
You're down the driveway... I'm on the couch

Chasing your dreams since the violent 5th grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
'Cause we'll be ok... I'm not going away
Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain

And pops stayed the same and your moms moved away
How many of our parents seem to make it anyway
We're just fumbling through the grey
Trying find a heart that's not walking away

Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone
We can feel so far from so close

Trying to prove who's right

Headed to a red carpet they won't know my name
Riding in silence all that we wanna say

About to board when you call on the phone
You say ""I'm sorry. I'll be waiting at home""

Trying to find a way down the road we don't know

And never be just what they want you to be
Now that you've grown so wise
Use that head and stop to think a little
Just 'cause you're crazy doesn't mean that you're free

Back in lame grade ten I was a total devastator, baby
Down in the school yard, they all fell to their knees
But it can't be '93 sadly 'cause I wish it could forever
You call it luck I call it tragedy

What would you say
If I fell apart, could you bring me back then
What would you say
If I fell apart, could you bring me back?

We got a rock DJ, we got a total fucking alcoholic
We got a thing they call the cybergirl
A warm ovation please for the dude who sold us Ecstasy
He's building homes now in the new third world

The snow just keeps on falling in Hawaii and all stations west
Find someone close and hold them like you care
This is a race to the end and I don't intend to win it baby
You go ahead, I'm gonna meet you there

D-A-D used to talk of relativity
That was way back when everyone was scared
Now that we're deep inside the wires there's a place to hide
You can do things they would've never dared

What would you say
If I fell apart? Could you bring me back then?
What would you say
If I fell apart? Could you bring me back?

So don't be scared
What would you say?
There will be things we never dared
If I fell apart, could you bring me back then?

So don't be scared
What would you say?
There will be things we never dared
If I fell apart, could you bring me back then?

Don't be scared, there will be things we never dared
Don't be scared, there will be things we never dared"
1389,Strange Talk,Cast Away,"Everyday after day, another question for you
If I could go back in time I'd find a reason for you
The more I seem to try, another secret lies

Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes

Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night

Every ends has a start just like a dream comes through
It won't be long till you'll find the feeling inside you
Before we walk, we crawl, but we can only try

Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes

Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night

Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want

I hope to get away some day
To feel just what I want
And to feel the hold you have on me
Climbing up a wall
I'm waiting for the weather to sway
I'm feeling like a fool
In a cage there's nothing left to say


Looking at the past
I try to push your words away
I'm rising up above to my sunset
Where the sky is grey
Taken for a ride now
I'm reaching out to take control
I'm searching for the truth 
When I know that it won't lead the way

Oh, I keep trying to run away, from what you're saying
Oh, I keep trying to run away, but I stay standing

Following a ghost
In the distance of a brighter day
It's swimming in my mind now
It's building like a tidal wave
Breaking down the walls
That have kept me climbing up so high
I feel the rays upon me
And now the shadows run and hide

Oh, I keep trying to run away, from what you're saying
Oh, I keep trying to run away, but I stay standing
Oh, I keep trying to run away, from what you're saying
Oh, I keep trying to run away, but I stay standing
Oh, I keep trying to run away, from what you're saying

1392,fun.,Some Nights,"Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?

I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? mmm, mmm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win, I always win

Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know (come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, this is it guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands

This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she call ""love""
But when I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from

Some terrible nights
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree

It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"

I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm tryin' hard to take it back

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight, we are young

Carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

At high tide, high tide 
Barely made it out alive

Fishermen working at night 
Not even once 
Did we see a light 
We didn't realize 
The forecast had been revised 
By moonless skies and
Shifty wind that gusts and dies

On the sand our keel is heaving 
But tonight we've got to be leaving
Travel through the day and into the evening 

Marathon how long we've been gone 
And still not yet set foot upon you

To one who's spent the night at sea
Adrift in the shallows, a modest repose
Adorn with coral, your bright colors show
Ushered in through a bridge that is never closed"

Feels like I'm losing myself to you

1407,The Raveonettes,Love In a Trashcan,"If you touch that girl you know it's OK
People say she's a whore anyway
I think she looks like a nice vamp
Looking for love in a trashcan
If you kiss that girl you won't be caught dead
She's the coolest girl you think you ever met
I think she fits right into my life
On the road till the end of time
On the road till the end of time

Now the time is right and you feel the need
To go down low and receive a treat
The jukebox churns out songs about sex
Come on baby, you're my best fix
Come on baby, you're my best fix

Love, love in a trashcan"
1408,Pinback,Good To Sea,"They're moving earth outside.
The ground is shaking like no beat.
A dense terrible sound.
At once both teeming and asleep.

It seems to me to be a sign.
I don't believe in such and yet
It seems to me to keep one eye on the situation's best.

It's good to see you
It's good to see you go...

It's good to see you
It's good to see you go...

It's really not that kind
To terrorize one in one's sleep
And if you really tried
You'd probably cut the chase too deep.

It seems to me that that's a fine way
To keep you off your feet.
There seems to be no other side
For the two ideas to meet.

It's good to see you
It's good to see you go...
It's good to see you/Got to keep your mind on somewhere else.
It's good to see you go.../Got to keep from thinking of your health

It's good to see you/Strange how your mind works
It's good to see you go.../Strange how your mind works

Oh no, I hit rock bottom.
Oh no, I hit rock bottom.

It's good to see you
It's good to see you/Got to keep your mind on somewhere else.
It's good to see you go.../Got to keep from thinking of your health

And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
When it comes it will feel like a kiss

Awaken from dreams of drunken car crashes
You saddened my friends and claimed all my lovers
I tried to stay still, so it will not see
Its talons rake the side of my face

Oh, when did you become
Such a slut?

When I held my hand to the flame
And I didn't think it would catch up
As fast as I could have run
Fate came a-knocking

A new disease came in the post
For me today

My feet are running like the wind

Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
It drowns my feelings in the sea
I dried out over on the beach

Father, tell me how it is
I know you've been through all of this
You ran away so many times
Your kid, your heart, a couple of dimes

Why waste time?

Nothing to say
Just want my head on your shoulder
Banana split

Woke up lookin' like a creep
'Cause I couldn't get no sleep
Snowflakes stirring to sleep
But my heart still beats for something sweet

Come on now, ease the pain
I ain't gonna fall for you again
So why don't you erase my name?
'Cause I won't ever feel the same

Could figure out what it's all about
I won't be there to hold you tight
Make a turn on the next runabout
Following the signs inside your mind

Yes, I've been here before
It's not gonna be like before
Yes, we've been here before
But I'm not gonna take it no more

Come on now, ease the pain
I ain't gonna fall for you again
So why don't you erase my name?

I'm sorry, I'm just different from you
I can't give you more than you want me to

When I'm gone, when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my walk
You're gonna miss me by my talk, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

I've got my ticket for the long way 'round
The one with the prettiest of views
It's got mountains, it's got rivers
It's got sights to give you shivers
But it sure would be prettier with you

When I'm gone, when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my walk
You're gonna miss me by my talk, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You wrong me twice and I keep coming back
Same song, again and again
You wrong me twice and I keep coming back

Tell me what the matter is, little man
I've got a pretty face and I wear a nice dress
Tell me what the matter is, little man
I've got a pretty face and I wear a nice dress

Why can't I keep you?
Keep you
Why can't I keep you?
Keep you

Every minute that I spend on you
I give you honey and I give you truth
All the other women they get treat so rude
Cry, cry, cause you make them blue
Running over town like you got no nerve
Sleeping in the shanty of a brand new girl
Call me after Nancy, but before Rachel
Why can't I keep you for myself?

Why can't I keep you?
Keep you
Why can't I keep you?
Keep you

Same song, again and again
You wrong me twice and I keep coming back
Same song, again and again

You wrong me twice and I keep coming back"

You've grown up really crazy...
Have I been too denying of you?

Golly Sandra!
You've grown up so crazy...
Have I been too untrusting?

To take me down to the bridge
Where you know I will always love you
And I'll go without stopping

Oh you are my star
And that's not really far away

Golly Sandra!

You look so beautiful...
It hurts me slightly

Oh you know I've tried so hard ...
I love you"
1437,Kings of Convenience,I'd Rather Dance With You,"I'd rather dance with you than talk with you 
So why don't we just move into the other room 
There's space for us to shake, and hey, I like this tune 

Even if I could hear what you said 
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear 
Because I haven't read a single book all year 
And the only film I saw, I didn't like it at all 

I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you  
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 

The music's too loud and the noise from the crowd 
Increases the chance of misinterpretation 
So let your hips do the talking 
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings 
And you'll make me smile by really getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing... 

(Getting into the swing...)
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you

1439,Miike Snow,Song for No One,"I met you on the Palisades
The sun was spilling kerosene
And I was feeling wide awake
Girl you can be so obscene
And when you sang a lullaby
A missionary called your name
You disappeared and hopped a flight
For the Serengeti plain

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This the song for no one
This the song for no one

I think I own a photograph
That shows her in the freezing rain
With the Italians on the bank
They know how to entertain
A string of pearls behind your hair
A music box to catch your tears
Now call your mother in L.A.
She hasn't heard your voice in years

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This the song for no one

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This the song for no one

You can jump a ride
But don't ask why
And don't close your eyes
This the song for no one"
1440,Evermore,Follow the Sun,"Come in close to the fire now
I want to see you a little brighter now
So take my hand as we turn to the wind and don't let go
We walk a world that's turning love
The destination is the journey love
So take my hand as we turn to the wind and don't let go

Let's follow the sun until the shadows fade
Cross the desert till we find our place
Think of where you're going not where you've come from
Just lift your eyes and follow the sun

I saw you in a dream last night
Amongst a crowd of black and white
And as you smiled colors burst into life and shadows go
I couldn't turn this heart to stone
And banish all of my feelings I've shown
Through thick and thin, rain and wind
Darling you won't be alone

Let's follow the sun until the shadows fade
Cross the desert till we find our place
Think of where you're going not where you've come from
Just lift your eyes and follow the sun"
1441,Mae,Just Let Go,"We've got all night just to make it all right
Would you take a walk with me?
I'll give you all I've got, just spare me your time
And I promise you won't want to leave

Are you
Are you falling for me?
This time
We'll find what we both need...

There's an old oak tree
We can swing and sway
Throw our guards away
(You're so far away)
When I look at you
You're so far away
I'm so far away
Oh, if you could just let go...

Wet your eyes with me, just for a while
I'll take you out of harm's way
And like these branches that shelter the rain
We can lay here in our own shade

Are you
Are you falling for me?
Just watch
The two of us will see...

There's an old oak tree
We can swing and sway
Throw our guards away
(You're so far away)
When I look at you
You're so far away
I'm so far away

There is so much that I could give to you
Just say you want me to
I know these roots could break the ground
And in the meantime, our leaves will turn
But rest assured, we'll get through anything

Are you
Are you falling for me?
Like I
Oh, I'm falling for you...

There's an old oak tree
We can swing and sway
Throw our guards away
(You're so far away)
It's just you and me
We can get away
We can get away
(You're so far away)
In this lover's play
We are happy here
Oh, in every way
Oh, and then we just let go...
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go..."

Beating through the town.

I am a champion.
I am the fire inside,
Of a loaded gun.
I am a champion,
I am a fire inside.

I don't want to waste my time,
I'm just trying to find my way.
Racing through a perfect town,
Racing on a perfect day.
And sometimes when I close my eyes,
I listen to the words you say:
""People love a rising star.""

In love,
I am your favorite son,
I am a champion.
I am the fire inside,
Of a loaded gun.
I am a champion,
I am a fire inside.

In the window in my mind,
Where the wind blows
From time to time.
Where the seed grows,
The perfect vine,
Where whatever's yours is mine.

I am your favorite son,
I am a champion."

You know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes

When I hear that wind and I think of Spring
Underneath an open window a carved out sign and
Often I would fight with my mind

When you washed your eyes in last night's tea
I thought you might come out from the dream to find that

(Rostam) Underneath the pine grew a patch of thyme
That I burned for six days in the sun
Till I heard the distant sound of drums

(Wes) Oh the queen had come and the King had died
And my forehead burned but I closed my eyes
And my forehead burned but I closed my eyes

(Rostam) Before I go I've got to run, down the street to the market cove where I could
Find six seeds to bring back to the yard and plant underneath the birch tree
No white skies or red sunlight

When you're not even remotely, remotely kind?

You can find love in the most extraordinary places
Hiding away so no one can trace them
You duck and weave through the maze of hatred,
And found yourself something but you kept it all

So why would I try?
When you're not even remotely, remotely kind?

You shot me with your golden revolver
Before I could take mine out of the holster
And you left me there lying on the ground,
And you were nowhere, nowhere to be found.

So why would I try?
When you're not even remotely, remotely kind?

Granted, there wasn't much for him to take

Tight-fisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him
That talk is even cheaper told in bulk
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder he'd never change

And so she yelled at him:

Don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU

Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change

She couldn't seem to make up her mind
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change

Don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time

Oh... Is it real? I don't know
But, I'll act as if it is
What's our deal? I don't know
But, I'll act as if it is what I think that it is
If it is, then this might just work

They were in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, they never quite knew what they had
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder they'd never change

And so they yelled out loud:

You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget

Yeah I know what I should get this time"

Open your mind, believe it's going to come true

Say the things no one else

So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking

Say it loud when you mean it, with caps lock emotions
Do what you don't do
Say it loud when you mean it, with caps lock emotions
I'm in awe of you

So you lie to yourself
Why you're just not scared
All the things that you felt
Were always there

So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking

Do what you don't do
Say it loud when you mean it, with caps lock emotions

You'll only get it if you give it away

You only get what you give away,
So throw your hate away.

The Greeks have got him
With their tales of lust and myths of grief
Lights from the big wheel
Casts shadows that dance around the fair

Time for consulting, whilst carouselling
The quiet before the storm
Now he's in trouble, we've all had trouble
But learned to keep it shut

You only get what you give away
You'll only get it if you give it away
You only get what you give away,
So throw your hate away

The Greeks have got him
Now he's solemn and beat up pretty bad
Just like his brother
He will wear leather to thicken up his skin

He can't see colours, or hear like others
And has fallen into sin
Now it's all laughed at, the stage is past that
And filled with you and me

(2x Chorus)
You only get what you give away
You'll only get it if you give it away
You only get what you give away,
So throw your hate away"

And then the words they come to you,
Driving away.
You just can't let it go.

And when they fight, they fight,
And when they come home at night they say,
""I love you, baby.""

And when it all comes crashing down,
What can you do,
To find what you're looking for?
And then the words will come to you,
Driving through the rain.

The skies are way too bright
You know them way too long
To run away tonight!

The point is the struggle, insecurity

Hopefully, you make no mistake
If you learn from what you've got to take
Good or bad, it's all gonna add up in the end but
You can never win

And it's the desperation to hold on to
Something that can't be held on to
So, Don't waste your time filling up my words
Don't tell me why, assume the worst

Hopefully, you make no mistake
If you learn from what you've got to take
Good or bad, it's all gonna add up in the end but

Don't tell me how
Don't break me down

1484,Paolo Nutini,New Shoes,"Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day-today life
So, I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And, I thought, These shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But, long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And, I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And, I felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
And I made my way to the kitchen
But, I had to stop from the shock of what I found
A room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
And, I thought, Hello, New Shoes
Bye-bye blues

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Take me wanderin' through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking till the break of dawn

Take me wanderin' through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking till the break of dawn

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling

You're taking over
And I'm feeling small
When I was a child
I knew it all

Nothing magical
No hologram behind the door
Just a chain reaction
But I know I'm made for more!

What am I thinking (if you're so sure it's rational)
While the world's shrinking (but that don't make it logical)
What am I thinking (if you say I'm just an animal)
I feel like I'm sinking (you can't explain away the way I feel)

And you're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down

In the silver sea
Giving us a light
Swimming over me
You could take it all
Or just hold me back
Because it feels so good
No one's innocent

Well I know you lied to me
We can end it now
We can really see
You've gone and died to me
You want to live again
Take it real easy, man

Get over it, get over it
It's not your fault, it's not your fault

When I pulled the top
Then she closed her eyes
So when the city wakes
From the sand to skies
When you float around
Like it hits 2044
So live the model life
No one knows what you're fighting them for

Well I know you lied to me
We can end it now
We can really see
You've gone and died to me
You want to live again
So it can be easy, man

Get over it, get over it
It's not your fault, it's not your fault

Get over it, take it easy man

With the sun shining down over me and you

And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through

And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun -so what the heck

'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh well, I look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say, ""Yeah, well I feel all pretty happy too.""
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it be Love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
And although not really, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time, I might not know you
In five years time, we might not speak at all
In five years time, we might not get along
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong

Oh, there'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go

There'll be love love love wherever you go

Roll the dice, pay the price
Dance with wolves in a pack of lies
The blood we crave shall drive us all insane

Outerspace, it's a lovely place,
Long lost love in flower vase
Laying on the floor, shattered, battered and bruised

So I'm tidying my room and trying to be careful
Drinking in the afternoon and lighting up whilst tearful

Hoping that you're still unhappy
I'll do everything I can
To make sure that you are never happy

Breaking out of this cocoon and clawing at the camera
Seeing you would be too soon, I'm stupid if I want more

Hoping that you die unhappy
I'll do anything I can
To make sure that you are never happy

Never had a doubt I'm losing

So unsure of every question in the dark
Trying hard not to make of with anything you gave me
I'm so scared and down on friends so please pretend there is no end

Trying not to be a victim in your game
Know your dirty ways and know you feel the same
It kills me deep inside, I hope you cry when you see what you have inside

Never had a doubt I'm losing
I'll do everything I can (I can)
To make sure that you are never happy (Oh no, oh no)

Never had a doubt I'm losing

Just do it everyday
Just do it every way

All my friends, they pretend
The end is just around the bend
But since you came along
I'm not believin' it

Sunshine, destiny
The birds and bees and centipedes
Until you came along
I never needed it

Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way

Money, power, a man of means
Chasing down irrational dreams
But when you came along
I was freed of it

Throw your TV out the door
One, two, three, four, on the floor!
And if you sing a song
You'll believe in it

Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way"

Get my backpack, I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seekin' ""In search of"" like Nimoy

I'm a peace-loving decoy ready for retaliation
I change the whole location to a pine box six-under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is 'Strike' and I'm thunder
With lightning fast reflexes on constant alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless
With no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
Till they see you break
They can't conceal the hate that consumes ya
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu

Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days visit and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
The war is over, so said the speaker

With the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when we used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance

Dance, dance, dance
I need a gun to keep myself from harm"

How could you ever let go
How do you recognize
The dirty face of gold
Behind that crooked line
Where you never knew you'd go

Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gunna hear

Echoes in the dead of dawn

Lost the track, struggled back
I'd wanted easy stuff to please me
Something in the dark began to squeeze me

Seen it there, thinner in the mirror
Totally focused, no hocus pocus
Dare I give in to this thing gripping my skin
To win, thinking how to

As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score rise up, angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

I lie down in the dust just under your eye
A scrap of paper, thin as vapour
Filling my clothes like smoke
A couple of the wires in my heart are broke

I float, I miss something, nothing but
Dreams, schemes, moments wasted
Taste I tasted, fate I'm fated
Re-edited again then copy/pasted

As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
[Score rise up, angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away]*

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

When I wanna quit, I suffocate it
I chew Bubblicious, stress repetitious
Vicious, I'm one outsider
Up above the streets on the DC wire

Higher, fire in my guts
In a rut, but what I've got
Is in no can, no other human
But I do get lonely, scared I'm phony

As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score rise up, angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

It gets harder

Waking up again all over again
If there's an echo
Repeat days I'd likely let go
And be the changes we are noticing

When we're running wild

Keeps us safely moving on in the dark

Into the moment like I'm standing at the edge, I know
That no one's gonna turn me around
Just one more step, I could let go

Oh, and in the middle
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now, I know
That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling
Don't stop, no I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

Oh, but now I'm falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

Now I'm going down
And I can feel the eyes are watching us so closely, oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

So keep calling
Don't stop, no I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

Oh, but now I'm falling

Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning (But now I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feed the tired hungry tooth (I'm falling)
It feels like I'm falling away, I can hear them calling for me (But now I'm falling)

Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning (But now I'm falling)

I'm as good as dead,
Cause all those eyes are all it takes
And all, I want, is you
So I pulled away
All I do is sit and wait
And I might as well
Write the words right on my face
That all, I want, is you
Always you

Because I've kept my heart under control
But lately, all this time its taken its toll
Said I tried to but I can't hold back what's deep in my soul
So darling please forgive me
I want you and you just have to know

And all my fears,
Creep and crawl across my skin
These four walls,
Are after me and moving in
And all, all that I want to do, oh
Is give up, give in,
And let this one see where it is
But I don't suppose I will

Because I've kept my heart under control
But lately, all this time its taken its toll
Said I tried to but I can't hold back what's deep in my soul
So darling please forgive me
I want you and you just have to know

That one of these days
I'm gonna find myself a way
I'll find the courage
And I'll find the grace
Oh and I'm going to know, just what to say
Oh and you'll walk on up
When you want this love
And you've had enough
And you keep giving up

Because I've kept my heart under control
But lately, all this time its taken its toll
Said I tried to but I can't hold back what's deep in my soul
Oh, So darling please forgive me

1525,Dragonette,Let it Go,"Let it go

We get a little faded the colours go
Running out of all our clothes
And the flash don't light when the battery's low

When you could stamp a foot down through the floor
It's a better plan by far
To blow off the roof and let in the dark
So we better get started

And if I were you, I'd let go
And feel it all over inside like a chemical
'Cause to tell the truth
I don't know
If it's ever over

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
And let it go

We could dig a hole right down into
Somewhere as deep as black and blue
And fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now

And we could carve a tunnel under
And find out just how low it goes, it goes
And we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light

Well if I were you, I'd look up
And find a place there in the sky where there's room enough
To spread it out, and look 'round
For where to land when you come down

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
And let it go

Let it go

Let it go

When you could stamp a foot down through the floor
It's a better plan by far
To blow off the roof and let in the dark, let in the dark, dark, dark
So we better get started, started, started
Yeah we better get started, started, started

And still I haven't got the chance to say
Always rolling off the tongue
Never said but nearly sung about a million ways

Every photograph and story
Trickled through the lengthy web of friends
I overthought but understood
Distant looks but looking good
And not the other way

But you, you fail to remember
But you, you fail to remember

Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time

Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time

With heat struck afternoons long through
Those idle dreams go back to you
The echoes seem somewhat displaced
Every form that's on her face, I'm drifting off to
Bored of mere flirtations
That's what's made of constellations that I've sought
Was this only in my head
Just like most things go misread when overthought

But you, you fail to remember
But you, you fail to remember

Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time

It won't end here, your faith has got to be greater than your fear

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry

You are looking for your own voice, but in others
While it hears you trapped in another dimension

Drop your guard, you don't have to be smart all of the time

And don't be shy, oh no, at least deliberately

No one really cares or wonders why anymore
Oh, I got music, coming outta my hands and feet and kisser, oh

That is how it once was done
All the dreamers on the run

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting
We're so quick to point out our own flaws in others
Complicated mammals on the wings of robots

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

In the city
Where I'm from
Lions in cages just for fun
But you will pace around your cage
And wait for night to come

In the city
Where I'm from
They shoot you down
If you run

But we don't stop to check the time
'Cause time keeps moving on and on and on

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

I see you in another place
I expect a familiar face
The city joins us with hands of grace
Hands free there are no constraints
Just ignore all that you see
The illusion of you and me
Illusions come illusions go
And if I leave you'll never grow old

In the city
Where I'm from
There are lovers till the dawn
And you stayed up to see the sun
I couldn't wait that long

Who's gonna get up after we're gone?
Who's gonna get up after we've fallen?
Who's gonna pick up what we've done wrong?
Who's gonna get up after we're gone?

The city joins us with hands of grace
Hands free there are no constraints

Illusions come illusions go
And if I leave you'll never grow old"

I lock the door and check my pockets
I'm leaving the light on just for the sight
Might make someone think that I'm still around

Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights
Walking rounds in search for stars these nights
The sky is perfectly brown instead of black
Let my shoes lead me forward, please bring me some luck

It's ok, hey come on, no time for education so let's go
I can't stand all these rules,
I'm gonna turn my back to everything I know
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me

I pick up stones 'cause I might need them
You're gonna throw'em, aren't you
I tried with books but I'm not pleased yet
Come on and read it for me, read it for me
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights,
I'm walking rounds in search for, doesn't matter

1539,Death Cab for Cutie,Long Division,"His head was a city
Of paper buildings 
And the echoes that remain
Of old friends and lovers
Their features bleeding
Together in his brain, oh
And once it started it was harder to tell them apart, oh

He was always distracted
By the very mention of an open door, oh
Because he had sworn
Not to be what he'd been before

To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder

The television
It was snowing softly 
As she hunted for her keys
She said she never envisioned 
Him the type of person 
Capable of such deceit, oh, oh

And then they carried on like 
Long division
'Cause it was clear with every page
Oh, that they were further away
From a solution that would play

Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder
Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder
Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder
Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder

He had sworn 
Not to be what he'd been before

To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder

You got someone new
I'm just a jealous motherfucker alone!
You got someone new
It makes me sad, but you deserve it

I heard some rumours about you and your ex
I heard some rumours about Lars from Vamoos
And Mario told me that you told him that you loved me
But you couldn't sit around and just wait for me
But who am I to talk? I always travel around
A new girl in every town
But you're my Supergirl, and I feel like kryptonite
The situation makes me just wanna sing tonight

You got someone new
I'm just a jealous motherfucker alone!
You got someone new
It makes me sad, but you deserve it

In the beginning I was that someone new
I'd love sneaking around and just hide away with you
We would meet at this tacky bar at the other side of town
Just so no one could find out about us two
I bet you're booking hotels with him and going to France with him
Just to get away from me
It's just now that you're gone I find out I was wrong
When I told myself I didn't need you...

Before.

We're welded in gridlock
We're watching the wall clock
All the literate small talk keeps us sane.
We work by the windows
Feels soft where the wind blows.
All the literate small talk keeps us sane.

In cubicles we simulate
A broken wall, a city state
We're lost in files, we've seen this place
Before.

A counterculture elevates
We cross it out, we can't erase
A sous rature, we've seen this place

Waiting for you to lose
Have you ever felt like you're living in a spot light
Searching for the real you
Tell me have you ever woken up
Just to wish you could close your eyes
Getting hard to find a friend in a city like this
Where you can't even trust a smile

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life
But right before you know it you find out in a moment
You're gonna have to say goodbye

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

Yep, yep, you know
If I can make it through then you can to
Yep yep I'm good focus like always
Feels like I've been hit hit hit by ten brick walls
Some people like just sit sit around and wait for you to fall
Then bounceback way quicker than you fell down
Laugh in their face like what
See nothing can break me
No no no no listen
If you gotta think twice about life
Something really ain't right
You don't need no help
You can be better all by yourself"

I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in my lifetime ain't good for me

Don't try to tell me that it's over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No girl could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand between my loving arms
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire

I hope that we will never regret, seeing sinners of the night
'Cause we can not, can't ever, no we can not, take it back (no)

It's simple understanding, I talk you understand me (ooh ooh ooh)
We'll wait until it's over, we knew they would be unfair

I hope that we will never forget, seeing sinners of the night

'Cause we can not, can't ever, no we can not, take it back

Now here we are, another voice from the afterlife
Who are we now? We know we're alive
I call you out, it's never why we were left behind
The sun creates a different escape while we're still alive

A magnificent drone, is serving under our feet
You will make the man rich, he'll throw you away
And after he's gone, HeLa's here to stay

The radiation makes you weak
And dried okays leave your speech
The world owes more than they'll pay
In the wind I heard them say...

Serenity intact, it's the feeling that I lack
Life in the floors of a stable home

I can trace you on paper like a sketch of a smell
You're a breath to the runner in contest
In close to the nerve, but you rest so far away
And I have to give it up someday

Every time I close my eyes, I see you in front of me
Pretending in a love like this
I have no choice but to put you in back of me
Don't cover my footsteps
Dead weight all right, I know you're no good for me
Dead weight all right, I know you're no righteous leader
You're dead weight all right, that's fine
You get your hands off me
You have to touch me with kid gloves
You have to touch me with kid gloves

Buy me to the wind, you talk me out of standstill
I never felt so alive at once
Finger to the quick, yes I can feel your hand still
Pressed to the drain of the common months

Cheer me up, cheer me up, I'm a miserable fuck
Cheer me up, cheer me up, I'm a tireless bore
Cheer me up, cheer me up, I'm invisibly stuck all in myself
Yes I'm a vanity whore

Because it's race and it's power at the center of life
We are blind to the people who need us
But you're the kind of person who could understand that fault
And I hope to measure you someday

And I can't shake them out

It's 6 in the morning, I'm still awake
My sleepless heart is torn up, babe
A love song's on the radio
But these words I hear they're not for me, no

6 in the morning, I'm still awake
My sleepless heart is torn up, babe
A love song's on the radio,
But these words I hear they're not for me, no

I'm tryin' to keep up, tryin' to move on
Beyond this pain, before I break

It's 6 in the morning, I'm still awake
My sleepless heart is torn up, babe
A love song's on the radio
But these words I hear they're not for me, no

6 in the morning, I'm still awake
My sleepless heart is torn up, babe
A love song's on the radio,
But these words I hear they're not for me, no

Not for me
They're not for me, no"

I Drive Like a Gangsta when I'm coming to see you

And I'm coming to see you all the time
I Got a bottle of cheap jug wine
Pop some pills and make some love and try to recline
I like to drive into the sun
I like it when your sitting gun
My single is on, it's number one

I Drive Like a Gangsta when I'm coming to see you

Outside I wait, I feel my body hesitating.
Can't find a little more time, this world knows how to take it.
Don't even know but I need somebody else to break this.

Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.

You're saying one thing but I just can't see the vision.
Not sitting right with the impression that you're giving.
Sometimes I wish the night could show me what I'm missing.
Hands tied, just act natural, I want.

Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.

Take me over, turn me on.
I can't stop, it's what I want.

1565,Freelance Whales,Hannah,"Do me this solid
If you would pretty lady
Please grab your martini
And meet me on the balcony
I've prepared a light show
You could fake a melody
We could argue over where and when
The cymbal hits should be

Hannah takes the stairs
And I usually take the elevator
Every now and then she offers me
A lemon Now and Later
Please don't play the matchmaker
Please don't be a player hater
If you dig her recent work
Then you should go congratulate her

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
'Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?

So Hannah let your roots grow
Let your blue veins show
If I need to take a breath
Then you can take a trumpet solo
I'll work on the limbs if
You work on the torso and
If it gets to be too much
Then you could lend a helping hand

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
'Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?

Hannah takes the stairs
'Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she outside-in

1566,Arcade Fire,Reflektor,"Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, a darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre les royaume, des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven, I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there, I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
(It was just a reflector) It was just a reflector
I thought I found the connector
(It was just a reflector) It was just a reflector
Just a reflector

The signals we send are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was 19
And now we're staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre les royaume, des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven, I need something more
Just a place to be alone 'cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
(It was just a reflector) It was just a reflector
I thought I found the connector
(It was just a reflector) It was just a reflector
Just a reflector

(It's just a reflector) Just a reflector
(It's just a reflector) Just a reflector
(It's just a reflector) Just a reflector

Just a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection or a reflection
But I see you on the other side (just a reflector)
We all got things to hide (just a reflector)

Just a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection or a reflection
But I see you on the other side (just a reflector)
We all got things to hide (just a reflector)

Alright, let's go back

Our song it skips on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, and they break it to bits
I want to break free, but the world will break me
Down, down, down, don't mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
(It was just a reflector) It was just a reflector
I thought I found the connector
(It was just a reflector) It was just a reflector
It’s just a reflector

(It’s just a reflector) It’s just a reflector
(It’s just a reflector) It’s just a reflector
(It’s just a reflector) It’s just a reflector
Just a reflection, of a reflection

Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflector. Just a reflector
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflector. Just a reflector
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflector. Just a reflector

I'm a little bit nervous
I'm goin' no where

I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go

No...
And I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit angry
When every one's around
But I get a little lonely
When no one's out

I feel my demons
Misleadin' me

But I don't wanna let it go

And I'm in the ground
The weight's off my shoulders
It was bringin' me down

I've never been that lucky
I've never tasted fame
I'm always lookin' for something
But I hate changin'

Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer
That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

My head is spinning and it won't bail out

That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I've been waiting a while to talk to you

She said I was a first time caller
But a long time listener
I've been waiting a while to talk to you

Falling like trash from the sky
I hit a patchwork of loneliness, crooked and wild
Hung from the stars and dropped through the night
To a heatwave in hard place-lessness, neon tiles

And I got nothing but time
She said I was a first time caller 
But a long time listener 
I've been waiting a while to talk to you 

She said I was a first time caller

1581,The Sound of Arrows,Wonders,"Come out tonight are you ready to live
Don't give it up, you've got much more to give
The city is dead but the night is alive
I still believe in this, don't let it die

I will never forget, the weight of the world
When we were together, I long to return
I will never forget, how you made me feel
Come make me relive the wonders of that time
Back when you were mine

Late by the beach caught the last of the sun
Young hearts together, our lives had begun
Wrote down a promise and threw it to sea
Know that your secret is safe here with me

You were always building me up
Are you ready, build it back up

In the distance, it's calling
It's closing in on you
What you're after, what you wanted
Every time was something new
Rest easy, I know all that we left behind
Is out there, still waiting
Somewhere back in time"
1582,Keane,Spiralling,"I'm waiting for my moment to come
I'm waiting for the movie to begin
I'm waiting for a revelation
I'm waiting for someone to count me in

'Cause now I only see my dreams, in everything I touch
Feel their cold hands on, everything that I love
Cold like some, magnificent skyline
Out of my reach, but always in my eyeline now

We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling

I fashioned you from jewels and stone
I made you in the image of myself
I gave you everything you wanted
So you would never know anything else

But every time I reach for you, you slip through my fingers
Into cold sunlight, laughing at the things that I had planned
The map of my world gets smaller as I sit here
Pulling at the loose threads now

We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling
When we fall in love
We're just falling
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling

Did you want to be a winner?
Did you want to be an icon?
Did you want to be famous?
Did you want to be the president?
Did you want to start a war?
Did you want to have a family?
Did you want to be in love?
Did you want to be in love?

I never saw the light
I never saw the light
I waited up all night
But I never saw the light 

When we fall in love
We're just falling
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling
We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling"
1583,The Limousines,Internet Killed The Video Star,"The kids are disco-dancing
They're tired of rock and roll
I try to tell them, ""Hey, that drum machine ain't got no soul""
But they don't want to listen, no
They think they've heard it all
They trade those guitars in for drum machines and disco balls

We can't rewind now; we've gone too far

You know we never listen; we think we've seen it all
Like everything we're doing, no one's ever done before
Did you hear what they said?
That rock and roll is dead?
Yeah, it's like a zombie: it will dig itself back up again

Tune in the signal but it's fading
Some ghost strumming his guitar on the radio
Singing, ""Oh, the glory days are gone 
But everything's okay, 'cause we still love our sex and drugs 
Just like the good ol' days""

The kids are disco-dancing
They're tired of rock and roll
Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
The kids are disco-dancing
They're tired of rock and roll
Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul

Well, I'm a horrible dancer; I ain't gonna lie
But I'll be damned if that means that I ain't gonna try
Yeah, I'm a shitty romancer, baby; I ain't gonna lie
But I'll be damned if that means that I ain't gonna try
Get up, get up, get up, and dance
Get up, get up, get up, and dance

Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul

Another level of my dreaming
I thought I knew where we were going
I guess the truth just ain't worth knowing

You'll believe again
I won't wake you
Let you sleep until this ends
Someday you'll be loved again
I could lie and tell you
We could still be friends
But you know it ain't true

Tell me how am I supposed to know
Should I hold you
Should I let you go, let me know
I'll let you go

And I don't wanna fight this feeling
But I don't know if I believe in plotting and scheming
You never tell me where you're going
I guess the truth just ain't worth knowing

It's a mystery... it's a mystery.

Tell me how am I supposed to know
Should I hold you
Should I let you go, let me know
I'll let you go
Tell me how am I supposed to know
Should I hold you
Should I let you go, let me know
I'll let you go

I won't wake you
Let you sleep until this ends
Someday you'll be loved again
I could lie and tell you
We could still be friends
But you know it ain't true

It's so heavy on my shoulders
It's a levee
And I'm over
How was I to know that I was holding
The wrong hand
I was holding the wrong hand

You'll believe again
I won't wake you
Let you sleep until this ends
Someday you'll be loved again
I could lie and tell you
We could still be friends
I could lie and tell you we could still be friends
I could lie and tell you we could still be friends

You can be wild horses
You can stop at will
And you will

Before you get out on your one way
I've got a ticket waiting for you under any name
You can be holy or a roller, oh anything
But whatever you choose — stay

You're a living thing

With what's been done to you""

Before you lay down in this place
Remember you can see a blackbird a thousand ways
You can be a soldier, you can be the snow
Under the boots of an army with miles to go

And you can be white horses on that hill
You can be white horses
You can carry heaven until

Yesterday happened just exactly as it did
You can't go back and undo it
You're not a knot you're not another dead end
Don't ever forget

Turning the hills inside out.

Now that you've let us all too far,
Into your heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart,
Oh into your heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart,

Come Unkinder moving facing us,
Come alive at night and bring us, bring us up,
Come Unkinder shake the buildings into piles,
Come Unkinder making eyes, a tougher love.

Come Unkinder moving facing us,
We can light the towers up and tie the wires,
Come unkinder moving closer, bring us up,
Come Unkinder making eyes, a tougher, tougher love.

We let our nights run,
We let them stream into our days,
Come to immerse us,
And tie us together, 8 ways,
Blood in our arms through too fast,
Filling us out past, life-sized,

And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore

The room's still now when I'm lying
'Cause the well of the night has gone dry
When they asked to behave, I paid them no mind
Now I doubt if I'd have been so kind

Hold me like before

See, I'm upset because I've always been stuck
But I don't know what it is I'm without
Guess I'm in love with always feeling down

See the problem was I was fully consumed
With all of the petty things that I couldn't do
All of the plastic products, shows and woes
I didn't ever show, I let it go

So I listen while I'm told
Sit back, don't think, get high
Take drink, sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink

I go higher
And I say ooh, oh ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold is so tired
And I say ooh no, I go higher

And I said ooh, what's it gon', what's it gonna be
Make me say ooh, what's it gon', what's it gonna be
I'm feelin' so cold, but they won't, but they won't believe
Make me say oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (let go of me)

So find me stuck in some scene
I wanna get out but there's no in between
So I sit back as I watch the crowd go
Never assuming that it's something so low

See the answer is this, if I wanna be free
I gotta stop playin' 'round and runnin' from me
'Cause all of the plastic products, shows and woes
Got my head feelin' low, no room to grow

So I listen while I'm told
Sit back, don't think, get high
Take drink, don't feel, just go
If you listen carefully then you won't feel so low

Sit back, don't think
The more I listen the deeper I sink
Ooh, I got higher and I say oh ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold is so tired
And I say oh, no, I go higher

And I said ooh, what's it gon', what's it gonna be
Make me say ooh, what's it gon', what's it gonna be
I'm feelin' so cold, but they won't, but they won't believe
Make me say oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (let go of me)

I say oh, I go higher
And I say oh ooh oh, I go higher
Get no sleep, feed the vampire
And I say oh no, I go higher

And I say oh, I go higher
And I say oh ooh oh, I go higher
This head that I hold is so tired
And I say oh no, I go higher"

Until you realize that you should go

Come in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling

In the dying light I'm the only one here
And I will cover you until you go
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me until you go

Come in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling

Into the night, for once we're the only ones left
I bet you even know where we could go
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It's a souvenir for when you go

Come in misery where you can seem as old as your omens

The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling"

There's been too much pressure in the border
And I need to calm down
Just to breathe here, oxygen in and out
There's been too much poison in the system
Festering toxins I am in round

Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air

We expire, but we got a life to live
And just lay, lay where we only forget
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are

Feel all, stop and slowly shock, to know
When we're to give, start the engine
To see the remiss, the homing sound

Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air

We expire, but we got a life to live
And just lay, lay where we only forget
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are

Oh, and we parted from the heart."

In California with my toes in the sand

Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about

One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away

The goosebumps start to race
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watched your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats' heart is for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about

Where we can be in private away from prying eyes

In the middle of spaghetti road
I know there's a light at the end
But the tunnel it seems so narrow

Trying to find my way but my shoes is feeling heavy
They say I'm always dragging my feet
Now the world is measured on how fast you can get it
So I'm left behind before I can reach
Before I can reach, yeah

Makin' a life for yourself
It's getting harder everyday, who are you!
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar,
Said he's trying to find a way, who are you!
Life isn't as long as you think
Spend it wise while you're awake, who are you!
Timing is father to you
And it will never be the same, who are you!

Who are you

Surrounded, oh he's taking part in the habitation of your soul
But just cause you like the way it looks don't mean it's gonna suit ya
Don't mean it's gonna suit ya
Now is not composure and I'm not in a hurry
Could you say that in a frugiless time
Before you even blink
The day is to the night
And the ball would drop the 13th time
Still you're wondering why?
Yeah, yeah

I'm making a move
While time over bares the rules
Don't pen can be stackin', this tale
I'ma never is tell what you sing is close to gamble
Compose the faith and all the things I've seen
Change the favor of successful things
Gotta be more than a dream, I know!
Sometimes I could be slow and then the rest of the pack
But rest assured, no matter how much I fall I never refrain
Get back on the bike
Peddlin' hard I generate life
Wanna be soft, flavor the world
Be an example to all the boys and girls 'cause

Makin' a life for yourself
Is getting harder everyday, who are you!
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar,
Said he's trying to find a way, who are you!
Life isn't as long as you think
Spend it wise while you're awake, who are you!

Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?

But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel and keep holding it tight
Till you're tottering off into that good night

Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time

Baby, baby, baby, baby right on

Hey heart on the run again

While spring is making promises outside
Red cars are quite rare I realize
And then I wonder which colour you would like

Woo-oh, oh-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Woo-oh, oh-oh, I feel you in every heart beat
Woo-oh, oh-oh, forever in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I watch the sky change to a darker blue
I can't think of another thing to do
And every song just makes me think of you
Because the singer sounds as if she was longing
As if she was longing, too

Seven little numbers
Baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers
Baby, I know yours by heart
Seven little numbers
Baby, they could make a change
Seven little numbers
Make a fire out of this flame

Woo-oh, oh-oh, forever in a dream that could come true

Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all? - tell me

Well, aren't we a little bit old now
For this crazy game?

Is it safe now
That winter's gone?
But I think we could use a little memory
To add to the database

I saved a little bit of money
I put it in a vault
Hidden behind the face on the red room wall

I took everything I wanted
I took everything I need
All in a day
Or maybe they just want me to leave

And all of the people
And all of the people stand
Standing to wait
Waiting for the concrete to break

And all of the people
And all of the people take
Take, take it away
You know, maybe you just made me believe

And the days
The days feel a little bit longer now
And the morning's bright

If we escape now
And leave this place
I hope heaven has another open door for us
When the days get late

I saved a little bit of money
I put it in a vault
Hidden behind the face on the red room wall

I took everything I wanted
I took everything I need
All in a day
Or maybe they just want me to leave

And all of the people
And all of the people stand
Standing to wait
Waiting for the concrete to break

And all of the people
And all of the people take
Take it away

But the airport line out in the street
Baby, I know you wanted to stay
But the weekend rush won't let us wait

Just thinking on yesterday

And she says stop, you know you lift me up dancing
You know how to find me, you take me away
With your idea of happiness and your heroes in your life
Now there's something I want to tell you before you walk away

Time, brings me to another day
Whether I'm ready or not
Tick, tick, ticking away
But it's nothing more than my mind
It's ticking in my head, won't stop

I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

Oh, I get so angry when they leave me to wait

I said, ""Baby, don't you worry 'cause this song can just wait""

I said, ""1, 2, 3""
I just don't stop
You want to stop me in the middle
I want to stop from the top
I said, ""1, 2, 3""
I just don't stop for you

'Cause I, I, I know it's over
Some things I just know 'cause I'm older
I, I, I know you don't want me but I just can't stand goodbyes

Oh, you wanna talk to me 'bout nothin'
Well, I wanna hear the radio
Alright, now when it's one o'clock it's time to listen down and low

I said, ""1, 2, 3""
I just don't stop
You want to stop me in the middle
I want to stop from the top
I said, ""4, 5, 6""
You're callin' it quits
I said, ""Baby, don't you stop me now -- I can't resist""

'Cause I, I, I know it's over

Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row...

If only
Your necessary silhouette
Unknown, join the dissidents

Got carried away
Now hiding from their lies and discords
Once remembered now forgotten

Come roll the dice for me
Roll the dice for me

Hold on better undone
If really on your own
Thinking this is fun?
Feathers fallen from the drapes
Fold her into pieces
Tied up and lace

Fences in a row
Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row...

Got carried away
Thought I would've let you know
Did you miss a message?

I know you still
Would rather mess with me than get going
She's been building up a castle in LA

Roll the dice for me

Hold on better undone
If really on your own
Thinking this is fun?
Feathers fallen from the drapes
Fold her into pieces
Tied up and lace

Fences in a row
Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row..."
1629,Wild Cub,Thunder Clatter,"I see you hidden in the night I found you
I see you separate from the others
Bent crooked in the light around you
Bathing in the sight of the others

I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

It was hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call

I met you in the dead of winter
I stood stranded in the water
Dug deeper than a crooked splinter
I turned away from all the others

Sad hopes I'd hidden under
Tangled inside of me
You spoke like broken thunder
Deep into the center of me

I hear it call in the center of it all
You're the love of my life
I feel it all in the center of my heart
You're the love of my life"

Wasn't prepared for this fight.
Wen't for the kiss and got the bite.

Gotta live out of your own hands.
One day it's hey-oh, hey-oh.

I think you're absolutely wonderful

Hold on, hold on
I'd give up everything for your admiration
Hold on, hold on
I wanna let you know that I'm never leaving your side

You and me, we're so caught up in awkward situations
Let me be, be the one who kills this contention
Nothing in this world will stop the beating heart I have for you

Seems so secure, that I adore

We'll, we'll write the prose
Narration flows, down to the ground
It's so profound getting these dreams
I have out of my head

You make me, you shake me, tear me in two
You call out my name and I will come to you
I'll be your server, deserver, whatever you choose
'Cause I like it, I like it

Smile, smile with my eyes
In this disguise, I still can't hide
All of my joys creating stars into the air

We, we can just wait
For time to take us to the moon
They call it lust
We call it trust, yeah, we call it love

You make me, shake me, you tear me in two
You can call out my name and I will come to you
I'll be your server, deserver, whatever you choose
'Cause I like it, I like it, I like it"

In a fancy raven dress on
She's all right when everything's wrong

She is dancing in the streets all night
She is merging with the city lights
She can cheat you or can be your guide
She's a spirit of the night

She's a spirit of the night
She kneels me down
She kneels me down
I wear a plastic crown

She's a metropolitain girl

Maybe someone that I could have known
Maybe lives or maybe plays a role

She's a phantom flying like a kite
She's got twilight walking by her side
She's the one who allways on my mind
She's a spirit of the night

She's a spirit of the night
She kneels me down
She kneels me down

I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
Ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

Sustained means some Sunday so are we
People speak all week, I just forgot what they told me

Leave it in work because you want to live a little
Pick up the girl in someone's borrowed mini

Because you move to the country, she comes back again
And then you move to the city but she goes abroad
Is she telling you something, is she getting bold?

I'll make a rough plan to sleep around,
I'm in a rut I need a change,
I'm a lazy rat if I am honest
My bold change of tack will fade out with the summer
I've got no appetite and all the girls are bummers

My baby doesn't look at me
The way I want her to look
She doesn't comprend
My baby's got it going on
She's got a friend hid in every street in this town
I want to go out but there's nobody home
I'll go on my own

Thus starts the lonely walking
There's always too much talking
I should have stayed home
She starts her cool caressing
The kid, she starts undressing
I should've stayed home
The dj's picking up speed
That's something I just don't need
I should've stayed home
The gossip's bearing down on me
The kids are pairing off in front of me
I should've stayed home
I should've stayed home

Hey lady, meet my mum and dad
You're a strange aberration
In this land of potted plants and boxlike houses
Where the girls like mouses
Breathe a long sigh of resignation
You resign yourself to keep on growing
Like the seeds you're sowing
You're a strange apparition In this land of grammar schools and gala days
The ladies set in their ways
You had a long conversation with the kid next door
He's a little slow
But in your favour, it shows
Cancel all operations
Tell your friends to move out to the sticks

Listen lady, leave the boy home
Cancel all operations

1694,Panama Wedding,Feels Like Summer,"News day cover page meant the killer isn't done
The county chief in Gilgo beach found another one
As we stood in our house burn beneath the sun
We thought all this time growing up yet we still feel young

Oh it feels just like summer time we're all fading away
All I know is that I won't be home tonight oh child
Oh and I'm feeling lazy my heart is beating now
I got a feeling maybe we're on our way tonight

TV weather line meant the storm would be awhile
On a rainy day we were caught in shame with the score board tied
As we sat in our seats waiting for the rain to lighten up we spent all night long holding out for that one last run

Oh it feels just like summer time we're all fading away
All I know is that I won't be home tonight oh child
Oh and I'm feeling lazy my heart is beating now
I got a feeling maybe we're on our way tonight

You know that I feel and though I see the morning
My heart is beating loud
I got a feeling baby we'll run away tonight

Sometimes I can't tell the ocean from the sky
Or the way the silver clouds touch the land fall down on the horizon line
I wanna kiss you now but baby I don't mean goodbye
I wanna set all the lights like a movie scene where we go tonight
I wanna set all the lights like a movie scene where we go tonight
Oh child

Oh it feels just like summer time we're all fading away
All I know is that I won't be home tonight
Oh it feels just like summer time we're all fading away
All I know is that I won't be home tonight"
1695,Shout Out Louds,Sugar,"Memory one
Smoke inside my lungs
I wanna get it out of me
So hit me, hit me

Since I was young
Sugar on my tongue
But I can't feel the taste of it
In an ocean filled with words, I'm lost

Memory one
Stuck inside of me
I wanna slow it down a bit
So hit me with that sledge again

Since I was young
Sugar on my tongue
But I can't feel the taste of it
In an ocean filled with words, I'm lost

There've been many times I don't know who to talk to
There've been many times I don't know who I want to be
And I've been tremblin' in the dark too long
And now I know what I've been searching for

Memories, they play
Tricks on me
In bright, bright sunlight
I forget where I want to be

And I'm growing old
Still sugar on my tongue
Still don't know the taste of it
In an ocean filled with words, I'm lost

There've been many times I don't know who to talk to
There've been many times I don't know who I want to be
And I've been tremblin' in the dark too long
And now I know what I've been searching for

A hundred times, a thousand times I've tried to
For a million years I haven't known what I've been looking for
And I've been tremblin' in the dark too long
And now I know what I've been searching for"

How did my focus stop?
I'd never let desire leave me blind
(Can't get enough)
Oh, no the voice is strong
You know you've done me wrong
I'll never let a feeling lead my mind

I gotta rise above, don't need to fret
'Cause if I was to take you home?
What's left when the danger's gone?
I'll never let a feelin' lead my mind

Would you like to know me, better, baby?

Think that you could show me, better, maybe?
Well, I sure don't wanna waste your time
Sure don't wanna waste your time
So lemme tell you that I'd be better off without you

Bite down the bullets, hun, slow motion switch me on
I'd never let desire leave me blind (oh, give it up)
Freeze frame, I dodge that shot
The bigger picture's not good enough
I'd never let a feeling lead my mind

I gotta rise above, don't need to fret
'Cause I would rather be alone
Than with you in the danger zone
I'll never let a feelin' lead my mind

Would you like to know me, better, baby?
Think that you could show me, better, maybe?
Well, I sure don't wanna waste your time

If you take a photograph
We don't care that we'll never be like you
That we'll never be like you
Love is so old, ever know for sure, know for sure
I know you, you'll be coming back for more
You'll be coming back for more

We can fight anything that we can use
All I do is just for you
Sometimes it feels like I've been trapped for years
All I ever feel is fear
Tell me why do they keep me in this place
In this place
Please don't trap us don't matter what you say
I know that you're not amazed
Soon I'll be gone

1702,Sheppard,Geronimo,"Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back
We can steal it
If we bridge this gap
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall

When I lost it

But I tossed it
Didn't understand
You were waiting
As I dove into the waterfall

So say Geronimo!

Well we rushed it
Moving way too fast
And we crushed it
But it's in the past
We can make this leap
Through the curtains of the waterfall

So say Geronimo!

Can you feel (my love, my love, my love, my love, my love) my love?
Bombs away

Well I'm just a boy
With a broken toy
All lost and coy
At the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand
As a broken man
But I've found my friend
At the curtains of the waterfall

Now I'm falling down
Through the crashing sound
And you've come around
At the curtains of the waterfall

And you rushed to me
And it sets us free
So I fall to my knees
At the curtains of the waterfall

So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

1705,The Griswolds,Beware the Dog,"We used to go
Where no one dared to go
And now you've changed the dragon on your own
She used to suck the fun out of me

Beware the dog who's selling songs about defeat
Begging for love but you're old enough to know better than you know
You hate so much and you're better off alone

She used to suck the life out of me
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now it's all just hazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
Crazy crazy crazy
(Wooh!)

Beware the ghost who lives on Salamander Road
Trapped in a cloud of smoke
It's old enough to know better than it knows
Ate so much you better leave that prick alone

She used to suck the fun out of me
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now it's all just hazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy

Ever since I left you the last time

Now I get lost, tracing my steps back
It cost nearly everything that
I'm not ready to lose today

No I'm not ready to lose everything I know, I'm letting go of
Paris, you know I held on too much
I left you at the station, I put you in my past
And now darling, all that shit's behind us
You never have to wonder, you never have to ask.

You never have to

Drink up every last drop and
Shake off the feeling that you're watching me now
I should have just told the truth.

But now sweetheart, listen to the way I
Cannot forget a single day I
Spent rolling all around the room with you.

It's just a fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this I can't breath
It's burning through my chest

A fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this I can't breath
I just need a rest from

Paris, you know I held on too much
I left you at the station, I put you in my past
And now darling, all that shit's behind us

Intricate scenes beyond your mind

I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me""

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me""

Oh, c'mon girl!

Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""

1720,Penguin Prison,Calling Out,"There's something I can never say
It's too complicated and you don't need to know.
I start but then I hesitate
There's too many people and I can't be alone.

I got a problem,
I can't decide
I change my mind about one too many times
You got a problem
I'll tell you why
There's something else around it I need to find.

Now I'm calling, calling out your name
Whenever you want me
I'm calling, calling out your name
You're not here anymore.

I can't be good at everything
So do me a favor and just take what you want.
Don't tell me what I never said
You start making sense and then I'll never be done.

I never told you, I never lied
You just believe me when I fool you every time.
I can't remember, don't tell me now
I never promised you that I'd be around.

Now I'm calling, calling out your name
Whenever you want me
I'm calling, calling out your name
You're not here anymore.

I got a problem,
I can't decide-
I change my mind about one too many times
You got a problem
I'll tell you why
There's something else around it I need to find.

Now I'm calling, calling out your name
Whenever you want me
I'm calling, calling out your name."
1721,Milky Chance,Stolen Dance,"I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me

I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it

Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it

Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you

Suspense controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it

Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor

1722,José González,Step Out,"Heart's on fire, leaving all behind
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you

Step outside, gonna step outside, I'm gonna step outside
Heart's on fire in the warming rain

Living life feeding appetites
Stake through every heart stop in the mood
Being glad, breathing appetite

Heart's on fire, leaving all behind
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you

Step outside, gonna step outside, I'm gonna step outside

Broke tooth one day, something's not the same
Blank head, that guy sweep the floor
Feel your presence in your absence, shut the door

Heart's on fire, leaving all behind
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you"

To tell me that you've had enough
Go tell your friends, go tell your friends
That you've lied to their face that you'll never break, break
I'll never be the one to break your heart

And you're never gonna see my face
When you're looking for it
And you'll see I'll never be in place
When you'll come to find
This is the last time!

Summer school never felt so cool
And you never want to lose your cool
But I saw your eyes, yes I saw your eyes
And they're never good, they're never good good good
You've always sucked at your goodbyes

But you're never gonna see my face
When you're looking for it
And you'll see I'll never be in place
When you'll come to find
This is the last time!
This is the last time!

That you're ever gonna see my face
No you're never gonna find my face
When you come looking for it
'Cause you come looking for it
And you'll see I'll never be in place
But I'll be fine,
You never left me another chance

1726,Young Rising Sons,High,"Inside my heart there's an empty nest (empty nest)
A heavy hate on a hollow chest (hollow chest)
Soft spoken like a disease
Is the way to incomplete me

Can you shake this hollow night? (hollow night)
Through my breaths, you're the highest high
Tell the truth or trust a lie
Is this hello, or is it goodbye?

Is this the low, or is this the high-igh-igh-igh?
High-igh-igh-igh high-igh-igh-igh
Just let it go enjoy the ri-i-i-ide
Without the low there ain't a high-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh

I found a ghost in the city lights (city lights)
Where all my wrongs have turned to rights (ah)
Heart broken into pieces (pieces)
It ain't a way we should live

From the ground up we will rise (we will rise)
I tipped my hat to the highest high
Every day is a compromise

If this is low, I'm looking for high-igh-igh-igh

Just let it go enjoy the ri-i-i-ide
Without the low there ain't a high-igh-igh-igh

And love means sacrifice
But it's sure worth the prize
If you get it right (eh!)
'Cause way up in the sky
There's no such thing as blind

1727,Portugal. The Man,Modern Jesus,"Come on in, take a seat next to me
You know we got, we got what you need
We may be liars preaching to choirs
But we can, we can sell your dreams

You don't need sympathy
They got a pill for everything
Just take that dark cloud
Ring it out to wash it down, but

Don't pray for us
We don't need no modern Jesus
To roll with us
The only rule we need is never
Giving up
The only faith we have is faith in us

We're the ones who start little fires
Yet they burn out
But when they're on the rise
They can't help but shine

And when the wave approaches
Take our ashes to the ocean
Who cares if hell awaits?
We're having drinks at heaven's gate

So don't pray for us
We don't need no modern Jesus
To roll with us
The only rule we need is never
Giving up
The only faith we have is faith in us

We know that we're helpless
At least we always assume
But we don't need to prove nothing to you
Let's keep the cool
You don't need to feel blue
'Cause we won't sell you nothing
You can't use

Don't pray for us
We don't need no modern Jesus
To roll with us
The only rule we need is never
Giving up
The only faith we have is faith in us"
1728,The Decemberists,Don't Carry It All,"Here we come to a turning of the season
Witness to the arc towards the sun
A neighbor's blessed burden within reason
Becomes a burden borne of all and one

And nobody, nobody knows
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all, don't carry it all
We are all our hands and holders
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun
And this I swear to all

A monument to build beneath the arbors
Upon a plinth that towers t'wards the trees
Let every vessel pitching hard to starboard
Lay its head on summer's freckled knees

And nobody, nobody knows
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all, don't carry it all
We are all our hands and holders
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun
And this I swear to all
And this I swear to all

A there a wreath of trillium and ivy
Laid upon the body of a boy
Lazy will the loam come from its hiding
And return this quiet searcher to the soil

So raise a glass to turnings of the season
And watch it as it arcs towards the sun
And you must bear your neighbor's burden within reason
And your labors will be borne when all is done

And nobody, nobody knows
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all, don't carry it all
We are all our hands and holders
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun
And this I swear to all
And this I swear to all
And this I swear to all
And this I swear to all
To all
To all
To all"

(I heard a rumour)
From your girlfriend's sister 
(That you knew me)
And you end up dancing
(Closer to me)

I know that I broke the rule already
She asked me if I'm single
Going steady
I just drop my head and took a step off into the dark

Standing on the black and white tiles
Don't dance on the lights cause the bears eat the pretty ones
We are like the islands divided

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is no body here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of a party line

Stay
You stay

I am on this morning quite distracted
The tug of war begins on our emotion
I am leaving many people feeling 
Worse than before

People like to drive the cars and smoke up
People like to sit inside and toke up
People like to shoot at things with borrowed guns
And knives

I am happy to look and run
Where were you when I was king in this part of town
Now the days of glory are gone

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is no body here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of a party line

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is no body here but your body dear
Nobody here but your body dear

Jump to the beat of a party line

But we don't have the money

Forget about it, honey
Trouble's never far away when you're around

See me running round the corner move me up into the upswing
Call me undone

Oh, oh, oh

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

Pushing paper
I do everything I'm told and yeah I do it for the money
Understating
Every action that I take until I know there's something coming

It's not easy there
When you feel the wear
Patience brings the chair
Oh, oh, oh

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

The messages won't stop they just keep pulling at you
Teasing us with the thought that that is something we'll do
If we could hold the tongue and focus all our time through
We would just rise above this cycle that we're bound to

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?

Learnt the rules from a brat sire

Burn it down

I should've gone, I should've known
That you're out of sight, out of mind

Run away to a little place with me
Where everybody thinks they're royalty
Just think of how easy life could be
Run away to a place that isn't far
Forget the jet, call us a car
It doesn't matter where we are

Won't you carry me away after endless boring dreams?
With you, starting every day we'll be high society
We'll drink Chardonnay through the day 'cause we say so
A silk lapel suits you well, baby you know
With you, each and every day we'll be high society

You never sleep late on Sunday
'Cause that's how it's done in Monaco
Except for when you came stateside
And never let me sleep late alone

Let's sneak into a country club and when
We can't get in slip them a ten
Isn't it fun to play pretend?
Have somebody else that we can blame
For all the things we do that cause us pain
Keep keeping on like life's a game

Won't you carry me away after endless boring dreams?
With you, starting every day we'll be high society
We'll drink Chardonnay through the day 'cause we say so
A silk lapel suits you well, baby you know
With you, each and every day we'll be high society

There ain't nobody dancing
Who looks better down and out on their luck
It's in our blood, we're above the highest penthouse
Tell me the world is ours

Won't you carry me away after endless boring dreams?

She got over my head
So wake up you dreamy boy
You're harnessing a giant
And you're painting on my wings
In red paint and my wings are feather white
Police sirens up
So you're an angel true in a movie down my street

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window
Wake up

You can't force change or change your path
You just have to walk on it, the woods at night
With red walls, leisurely slow, no one sees you moving but you
So long my friends
I think it's time you try again
So wake up, wake up

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window
Your window, your window

Wake up
Wake up

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window
Your window, your window"

You can try just about anything

You might not want to see it

'Cause I'll make it my problem

Don't run
I know it's harder to stay
There is no easier way
To face the mess we've made

Don't run
I know it's harder to stay
There is no easier way
To face the mess we've made

You say you don't like living here
But your reason's never really clear
Maybe you don't know what to do.
I'd be poor as hell if I were you.

You might not wanna see it

So when you turn around you know

Don't run

Running after me in the pouring rain
Screaming baby you were right
I need you, I need you

Calling my name is a twisted game
Cause it wears me down
Till I love you more
Waking up to us making up
Makes it better than before

Wind me up tight
Convertible nights with you
I'll give you romance
A hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you
My love, I want you to give me all of you

Get to know me in your back seat
Drive me crazy then you drive me home
The only place I wanna be
Is with you, with you

Trying my luck
When I woke you up
Throwing all your clothes
Out the second floor
Waking up to us making up
Makes it better than before

Wind me up tight
Convertible nights with you
I'll give you romance
A hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you
My love, I want you to give me all of you"

That's what I tell myself, but I don't know know

So I ran 'til I couldn't & I screamed, until my voice was gone

And I don't believe in the truth, truth
Because all of my life's built on lies

Got me looking for love

Little sympathy
Cause a long way back never comes easily
Even a young girl knows
That the first sign of love falls flat where the cold wind blows
A single syllable contains my history
Never know one word could mean so much to me

Fell in love with the traveling man
I'll make him mine
Do whatever I can
Fell in love with the traveling man
I'll make him mine

Touching me with such sweet blindness
Hiding where our past can't find us
Need to find you another door

I can't live on metaphors
Oh baby I need more

Sheltered, you better keep the wolf back from the door
He wanders ever closer every night
And how he waits baying for blood
I promised you everything would be fine

Oh, my love
I know you're used to desperate men
Who say the words that others said
For too long and for too often

But baby, you can lay off a little bit
No need to smother it
I can put your doubts to rest

You're the only one worth seeing

1830,Dresses,Sun Shy,"I'm a little sun shy when the sun shines on the wrong day
And I believe my bed is a constant bearer of these sun shades
'Cause I'm a little sun shy when the sun light beckons I wake up
Oh, I won't wake up

I make my days my nights that's when my heart gets pumpin
I'll take you for a ride, my nights only just started
Show me some place I'd like, make me feel like I'm dreamin'
Oh and I won't wake up

Though I don't know where I go
Light it never done much for me
But lead me down a lonely road
Hit the lights so I can see
That I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy
I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy

Why are your eyes still closed, can't do much when we're sleepin'
I'll wake you up and show the night is where my heart is
We don't need daylight to feel right come close to me
And we'll stay up

Though I don't know where I go
Light it never done much for me
But lead me down a lonely road
Hit the lights so I can see
That you and me are company
Enough to make the sun explode
We'll lose the lights and harmony
In the night I'll have control
'Cause I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy
I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy"
1831,The Royal Concept,World On Fire,"I see the world has gone mad
I see them talk the talk walk walk the walk but nothing stands out
I see the world has gone mad
I think ill do you like I used to do do it all night

I see the world has gone mad
I say we do it like we used to do fuck the
Where is my band, where are my friends
They turn to DJs and just hit it hit it big time instead

Tell yourself this night won't end
Promise land let us escape

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the worm from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire

I see the world has gone mad
I say we do it like we used to do do it all night
Where's every what's their next move?
I say just fuck them let them know that they ain't doing no good

Get the job, get the job, get the job done.
Do it like we used to do it do it all night
Get the job, get the job, get the job done.
They do it like they used to do they do it all wrong

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the worm from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire, the world on fire
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go

Tell yourself this night won't end
Reach out and take my hand
I told you twice this has to end
Reach out and take my hand
Tell yourself this night won't end
There is no time to lose

Promised land let us escape

1832,The Vamps,Wild Heart,"I was walking away,
But she's so beautiful it made me stay

But I'm hoping she might feel the same
So here I go again,
She got my heart again!

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart

Stay here, my dear,
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
My mind's beat up
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
I won't give up

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine

And I know it's late, I know it's cold
But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go
The way you move-it's wonderful
Let's do it now, 'cause one day we'll both be old
Oh whoa oh

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine

1833,Mike Posner,I Took A Pill In Ibiza - Seeb Remix,"I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said ""tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs"

1843,Generationals,Black Lemon,"I let my old life tie me to the tracks
I heard my best friend tell me
You can never go back
I spent my long years
Learning to get out of the way

I have been taught to turn the other cheek
I get my back stabbed buddy
To the end of the week
I only try to make it to the end of the day

I've seen it break so many before
I don't wanna stick around
Here and watch anymore
I'm not about to fight until the last of me dies
I'll be resting my eyes
I'll be resting my eyes

Try to follow a path to lead me to the light
But when your load gets heavy
Maybe call it a night
Roll it around and take it from the bottom again

I'm not afraid to lean over the ledge
But if you take too many you go over the edge
Make it a point to tell me when you get to the end

I've seen it break so many before
I don't wanna stick around
Here and watch anymore
I'm not about to fight until the last of me dies
I'll be resting my eyes
I'll be resting my eyes
I'll be resting my eyes"

I'm driving down 101
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
All the friends are waiting down on me
And I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
I'll see that day alive

My brothers give strength when I am alone
They help me push on through the dark
To the other side
My sisters give me love when I am numb
The music's honey to my ears
Every time

I'm driving down 101

To make it straight again

I can't run but I can't stay, you know that
I won't stop until the day I break
'Cause what we were is lost now

Set it free
Let it go
'Cause you already know
We're high again
High again

Set it free
Let it go
'Cause you already know
We're high again
High again

It's not a question we can answer
Not a thing that we can do to change
It's all the same

Feet in the sky, head in the sand, don't lose it!
Well I guess that this must be the place
The perfect day again

I can't run but I can't stay, you know that
I won't stop until the day I break
'Cause what we were is lost now

Set it free
Let it go
'Cause you already know
We're high again

But I can't get you off my mind
I'd sleep in the pouring rain
When will you come home again?

Spinning like the Gravitron when I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change but they never did
Spinning like the Gravitron when I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change but they never did

I'm hanging on the end of this rope
Somewhere on the outskirts of hope
Life without you not around
Another kid in Lonely Town

And I'm spinning like the Gravitron when I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change but they never did
Spinning like the Gravitron when I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change but they never did

Now I'm standing outside your house
And I'm wondering baby
Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you feel the thud when I fall?
Do you hear the crack when I break?

Did you lock the door when it shut?
Did you see the knife when it cut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground
For the kid in Lonely Town?

Lonely Town
Kid in Lonely Town
Lonely Town

Spinning like the Gravitron when I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change but they never did
Spinning like the Gravitron when I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change but they never did

Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you hear the crack when I break?
Did you lock the door when it shut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground for the kid in Lonely Town?

You aren't allowed to talk - oh no,
You aren't allowed to talk - oh no,
You aren't allowed to talk

There's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean Philosophy
And you say I'm such a cliche,
I can't see the difference in it either way.
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

You're so conceited

I felt just how you feel
But now I have forgotten you took my heart and lost it
And suddenly it's beating once again

Goodbye old memory, I'm moving off your road

Just blind and drunk, we can never see what's real, see what's real

When I wake up in the morning I will pack my things and go
With the wind at my back
Fade away into black

I've been stuck with the same kind of people
Just blind and drunk, we can never see what's real, see what's real
I've been trapped in all kinds of places
Take me away so I can find what's real, find what's real

Home
Home
And in the morning I will go
I've been stuck with the same kind of people
Just blind and drunk, we can never see what's real, see what's real

I've been stuck with the same kind of people
Just blind and drunk, we can never see what's real, see what's real
I've been trapped in all kinds of places
Take me away so I can find what's real, find what's real
What is real
What is real
I've been dreaming"
1871,Diamond Rings,Runaway Love,"I wanna wake up in a different city
I wanna wake up in another town
I wanna wake up and I want you with me
And I don't want anyone else around

We could be the only ones who matter
We could be the only ones who know
We could also be a real disaster
But whatever never mind let's go

When I'm with you all the skies have rainbows
When I'm with you all the clouds have sun
When I'm with you I can take off my clothes
When I'm with you we can both have fun

You and I can make it extra special
You and I can make it super cool
You and I can beat the extra level
You and I can make or break the rules

I wanna be the light to your dark
I wanna shine like gold
I wanna burn my name in your heart
I wanna lose control
Tell me you need me when we're apart
You're what I'm thinking of
You better get set before I start
Running away with love

So come on I know you have my number
So come on I know you know my name
So come on before I start to wonder
Whether or not we both feel the same

I'll be waiting for you where we started
I'll be waiting right where I belong
I've been waiting ever since we parted
I've been waiting trying to write this song

I wanna be the light to your dark
I wanna shine like gold
I wanna burn my name in your heart
I wanna lose control
Tell me you need me when we're apart
You're what I'm thinking of
You better get set before I start
Running away with love"

1873,St. Lucia,Dancing On Glass,"Science and reason will tell us so
The blood in our veins are just chemicals
Better believe I keep my demons to myself
Better believe it's getting harder
But I'm never gonna stop until it's broken
Never gonna stop until it's broken

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Until we break it

Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass

We all have our secrets, our secrets know
Our violence mistaken for silence, oh
Better believe I keep my reasons to myself
Better believe it's never been easier
And never gonna stop until it's broken
Never gonna stop until it's broken

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Until we break it

Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Until we break it

How long 'til we learn
That dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Until we break it

Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass"

'Cause I'm already over and you take too long
'Cause there's something else that you never thought
Go on, think it over

'Cause I don't know what I like
I can't begin
'Cause I don't know what it's like
It never ends
'Cause I don't know how to fight
I've never been

Anyone that I want, anyone that I want
Over and over, once you get over
It never gonna end, it's never gonna end
Show me the way, just a little late

But it's never gonna end, it's never gonna end
Show me the way, just don't sit and wait
Or it's never gonna end, it's never gonna end
Everything I know I can't tell anyone, anyway

'Cause I don't know what I like
I can't begin

'Cause I don't know what it's like
It never ends
Oh no I've been
Over and over, once you get over

It's never gonna end, it's never gonna end
Show me the way, just a little late
But it's never gonna end, it's never gonna end
Show me the way, just don't sit and wait
No, it's never gonna end, it's never gonna end.
Never gonna end Show me the way, just a little late
But it's never gonna end, it's never gonna end
Show me the way, just don't sit and wait
No, it's never gonna end, it's never gonna end."

They come running
It's the weekend

And all the parents
They keep calling
But there's no answer
'Cause it's the weekend

Working class to the bone
And I know you're tired of hearing it
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
This right here is the D.O Proletariat
It's the weekend
Come on the weekend

Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy

Tonight I might just loose my way
But I'll never get down hearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy

And all the kids now

Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy

Rest when we're old
Should do as were told
But I just can't help it
I'll reach for the stove

The night closes in
Now for the second act
Tell our friends go ahead
'Cause we're hanging back

Youth like a spark
It lights up the dark
We unlock the mystery
I knew that you'd miss me
My mouth on your neck
Your touch on my check
Let hands guide the way
As we play hide and seek

Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do when I come for you uh oh
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do
Yeah my arrows shoot for you
My arrows shoot so true
These arrows shoot for you
My arrow shoots so true

Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy

Tonight I might just loose my way
But I'll never get down hearted

Do you mind if I do?
I know I can be honest with you
'Cause I don't like it as it is

I don't like it as it is
A disaster scenario
So don't look at what you did
This melted Gelato

Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
It's not love but wait

I'll be standing by the jukebox
Champagne or Prosecco?
I was playing classics by the Buzzcocks
Battiato and Lucio

Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
Open up your legs

Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
I'll say Ti amo till we get along
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
I'll say Ti amo till we get along

You don't mind it as it is
Bonanza, che bello!
Well I'll show you how to win
My festival di Sanremo

Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
It's not over yet

Now I'm looking like the bad cop
Sunbathing in Rio
Switching unsophisticated soft rock
To Beethoven's Concerto

Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
Open up your legs

Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no

Don't tell me, don't tell me no

1895,Portugal. The Man,Feel It Still,"Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave her with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Mighta had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies

We could wave until the walls come down
(Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little tip
Kids in the middle, move over till it falls
Don't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

1898,Colony House,Silhouettes (Casio Version),"Are you half empty?
Why don't you fill up?
There's no sense in holding
Onto something broken

Did you lose something?
Or someone you love?
You've still got that story
Tell it every morning

Driving down a road, down a road that's rolling
All the lovely memories your heart's been holding
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Driving down a road, a road that's hidden
All your faithful memories, your faith for living
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
So come on!

Nothing is perfect
For that there's no cure
So don't you start to bury
The good with the bad and the ugly

Driving down a road, down a road that's rolling
All the lovely memories your heart's been holding
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Driving down a road, a road that's hidden
All your faithful memories, your faith for living
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
So come on!

And I can feel your heartbeat slipping away
It's hard to catch the light
When you're running from the day
So wait for it, wait for it, wait

Driving down a road, down a road that's rolling
All the lovely memories your heart's been holding
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Driving down a road, a road that's hidden
All your faithful memories, your faith for living
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on
So come on!"
1899,COIN,Talk Too Much,"Caffeine, small talk
Wait out the plastic weather
Mmhmm, uh uh, discussing current events
I'll take my time
I'm not the forward thinker
You read my mind
Better to leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much

You know my type
Tightrope across the table
Mmhmm, uh huh, I can't keep holding my breath
New wave, no time
Red velvet under pressure
Blah blah, green eyes
I never leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much

Silence is golden, and you've got my hopes up
We talk too much
No hesitation, what are we waiting for?
We talk too much

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much"

I won't do those same things

We're disappearing

We can take our time to find a way
When the wolves are howling
You can always find the words to say
When the wolves are howling

Our light will lead us home
We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost
We can take our time to find a way
When the wolves are howling

Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling
Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling

Hot nights on our own
Spin and shake as we go

They won't see the same thing
Disappearing with the wind
We're disappearing
