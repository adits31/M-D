3,N.E.R.D;Rihanna,Lemon,"The truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off

Hate! Bad bitches wanna be my bae
Hate! Hunt me down like the C.I.A
Hate! Side of my car, tryna see my face
Hate! Want me to beat it like the T.I. case
Oh (hate!) and if it's heated I'ma feed my face
Hate! And best believe, it's gon' be outrageous
Hate! Hatin' niggas can't believe my race
Hate! Niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

Hate! You keep askin' me where I'm from
Hate! About the borders and, ""Did I run?""
Hate! Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
Hate! There's a light and dark army, which side you choose? Oh
Hate! If not now then when?
Hate! And if not me then who?
Hate! Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
Hate! I tried to tell y'all about this dude

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Hate supplements are found right in their couches
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

Wait, wait a minute
Shout out to them people, people
Wait, wait a minute
P-p-p-people, people
Wait, wait a minute
Mad ethnic right now

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get
Count the motherfuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Motherfucker, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'

And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
It's Rihanna, nigga
My constellation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get
Count the motherfuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Motherfucker, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me...

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

You can catch me
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute

Can you hear me, as I scream your name
Hello, hello
Do you meet me, before I fade away

Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

Hello, hello
Nice to meet your, voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you
How can I forget

Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side

One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger

'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort

All this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

Found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

29,Rita Ora,Your Song,"I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alone without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say ""love, baby, let's go back to my flat""
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason so man, put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that

No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips, through my heartbeat thumb

And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say ""love, this is what is all about""
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that"
30,Portugal. The Man,Feel It Still,"Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave her with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Mighta had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies

We could wave until the walls come down
(Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little tip
Kids in the middle, move over till it falls
Don't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Mighta had your fill, but you feel it still"

You were over on the westside, westside
I was always on your best side
Giving you the best signs, best signs

Ever thought we did a red light
Then you had to switch sides, switch sides
Wait a minute girl, I think you're forgetting

We more than material
Will you handle my affection, my attention, oh
Now you out there on the streets as if we're blessings
Out there bakin', o-oh

And I tell you all the time
But you don't get it, you don't get it, no
So trying to hit my guilty conscious with a text
Like who you're texting, o-oh

Question

I thought I told you I don't mess with you no more these days, o-oh
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days, (days)
So you can't come back to me, o-oh
Once you leave girl then you leave
But then you can't come back to me

I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days
I ain't playing if you say so
I was never unfaithful, faithful
Don't act up on your lame-fall
And try to call me on your way home, way home

You took your heart off the table, table
So who the one to blame for, blame for
Wait a minute girl, I think you're forgetting

We more than material
Will you handle my affection, my attention, oh
Now you out there on the streets as if we're blessings
Out there bakin', o-oh

Once you leave girl then you leave o-oh yeah
Now then you can't come back to me
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days

Naw baby I ain't coming back
Don't you think I'm ever coming back
I've been good on my own, now
I found somebody I can trust now (found somebody)

So baby I ain't coming back
I made a change and I stuck to that
Feeling better on my own now
I'm doing better on my own
My own, my own, my own, yeah

I thought I told you I don't mess with you no more these days, o-oh
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days, (days)

To get away from your parents
And I thought, ""Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought ""How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else""

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

And the pages have always been blink like the trees in the wild
But the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
Time in time, I know when it's time to leave

If the memories we make, will never been lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
And time in time, I know when it's time to leave

And the memories we've made, will never be lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won't forget the one who's making you shake

Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won't forget the man who's making you shake

You confuse me with your riddles and your sudden generosity

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

You can have it when you come by, you can have yourself a one-man way
I saw you when it caught your eye and it's such a petty price to pay

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't be out this late
Really wanna make you feel home
Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't get this fucked up
Really wanna get it to you

Slide another shot by and wipe your dirty hands on me
Swallow till you go blind and find a little company

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

Digging a ditch

I wanna find the key to the sky and never come back again

I wanna wake my soul, climb the highest mountain
I wanna write my name in the clouds and never come back again

I wanna find my love, lose myself in passion
I wanna love her in my heart and never come back again

I wanna see the end of a world that's rounded
I wanna know what it feels like to never come back again

I wanna ease my mind of all the doubt that haunts it
I wanna run out in the light and never come back again

And time put a rope around my head
And hung from the rafters of my fear
Dark in the eyes
Try and face the world, I can't bear to
My knees hit the ground and my hands start shaking
Old feelings from new faces
A rope on the floor and a poor man hanging
Please help me chop this tree down
Or hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me

I've seen an ocean run away
I'm torn from the truth that holds my soul
I'm down in the grave where I belong
Oh, what a ride
Identified my devil
Wings to the sky on the run from trouble
With my own hands, no shovel
I dug through the ground, now I'm hanging above saying
Please help me chop this tree down
Or hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (when the sun went down)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (it set the sky on fire)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (I saw an angel fly)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (I never felt so high)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved

76,Of Monsters and Men,Dirty Paws,"Jumpin' up and down the floor
My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talkin' trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

So, for a while things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws"
77,Tall Heights,Horse to Water,"The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken
I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold
In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot
I willed the car to start to bring me home to you

Lead me back from the darkness like you do

Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview
To wish back an image of myself I thought was true
So now when colors fade and on that day of days
I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue

Oh and lead me back from the darkness like you do

Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes
Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit
I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken
Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big

But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met
You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago
There was something about you I struggled to forget
My blood was rushing down to you

You were leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse
'Cause you're a wanderer too"
78,Twin Forks,Back To You,"I was young so I forgot
Which was my place and which was not
Thought I had a good shot
I took it right in my eye

Look ahead, look behind
Take another, I don't mind
I, oh, I, oh

Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you

So, put a posey in your hair
Pretend you couldn't give a care
Whistle past the graveyard
Even the dead deserve a song

Let the moon do what she does
She don't need to make a fuss, ah
She don't know she shines for us, oh
Something tells me that she does

Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you, back to you

Time after time, I follow signs
(I know they wind)
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you, back to you

Love, lower your eyes
Leave me a sign

Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you

80,The Lumineers,Flowers in Your Hair,"When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
It takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And how we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured

'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one
To being ignored

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes ai yai yai
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late 'cause you're attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes ai yai yai
And be in my heart"

I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone beat down on bony backs
So far from home where the ocean stood 
Down dust and pine cone tracks

We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog where all around us 
The bloom of summertime

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags, 
I've come to know the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone 
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls now.

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.

We grow, grow, steady as the morning
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, steady as the flowers
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still"

Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways

Need to start saying yes more

It's life and I'm supposed to live it out
I'm holding on to the universe

95,Sylvan Esso,Coffee,"True, it's a dance, we know the moves
The bow, the dip, the woo

Just like a name I remember hearing

Wild winters, warm coffee
Mom's gone, do you love me?
Blazing summer, cold coffee
Baby's gone, do you love me?

Wrap me in your arms

96,Of Monsters and Men,Little Talks,"I don't like walkin' around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keepin' me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothin' we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now, wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

But most days it don't start
But that paint shines just like new
And I've got dumb friends
But man, I love them

Climb to the rooftop, forget what we don't have
Ya, we wouldn't have it any other way

And all I need is to be struck by your electric love

You can tell me what you see
I will choose what I believe

Hold on, darling
This body is yours,
This body is yours and mine
Well hold on, my darling
This mess was yours,
Now your mess is mine

Your mess is mine

See you in the marketplace
Walking 'round at 8 A.M.
Got 2 hours before my flight
Luck be on my side tonight

You're the reason that I feel so strong
The reason that I'm hanging on
You know you gave me all the time
But did I give enough of mine?

Hold on, darling
This body is yours,
This body is yours and mine
Well hold on, my darling
This mess was yours,
Now your mess is mine

Bring me to your house
And tell you sorry for the mess
Hey, I don't mind
You're talking in your sleep
Out of time
Well, you still make sense to me
Your mess is mine

Your mess is mine
This body's yours and this body's mine
Your mess is mine"
100,Of Monsters and Men,Mountain Sound,"I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I had caused with my two hands
Alone we traveled
Armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

We sleep until the sun goes down
We sleep until the sun goes down

We sleep until the sun goes down

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down

102,Boy & Bear,Southern Sun,"In all you've seen
Was it that came down on me that night
A conjuring, I held on to that moment and lie
Just to make it alive

I stood out there in the covering
In the baskings of a holy night
Oh I was lucid and conscious
And hovering like a firefly

My mind stretched out on the canopy
It put its arms out slow
I heard the whispers of silence
Floating down from the radio

So come on, come on, I'm ready now
I got that feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul

I saw the light from a kettle gun
Sixteen days under a southern sun
And there were times when I thought that
I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there

You wouldn't believe me if I told you so
The things I saw, were enough to make the man in me
A man of me, make a man of me

So come on, come on, I'm ready now
Go get your things out honey let's get ready to roll
Oh I can feel a wave coming over me
I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go

As a child I was wonder eyed
At the thought that I might know
A life in the ecstasy of Rock 'n' Roll

Oh I'm not taking it slow
I'm an arrow in a bow
Oh you think that I don't know
What it is that makes it glow

So come, come on, I'm ready now
I got that feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul"

Take all the courage you have left
Waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I my dear?
Didn't I my...

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble little lion man
You'll never settle any of your scores

Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else
Spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I my dear?

And you've just gotta keep on keeping on
Gotta keep on going, looking straight out on the road
Can't worry 'bout what's behind you or what's coming for you further up the road
I try not to hold on to what is gone, I try to do right what is wrong
I try to keep on keeping on
Yeah I just keep on keeping on

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road

I've woken up in a hotel room, my worries as big as the moon
Having no idea who or what or where I am
Something good comes with the bad
A song's never just sad
There's hope, there's a silver lining
Show me my silver lining
Show me my silver lining

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love

I won't take the easy road

I lost my time here, I lost my patience with it all.

We lost faith, in the arms of love.

Where you been hiding lately, where you been hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately, we've been fighting with the wolves.
With the wolves.
Red tongues and hands.

Falling from high places, falling through lost spaces,
Now that we're lonely, now that we're so far from home.
Watching from both sides, these towers been tumbling down,
I lost my mind here, I lost my patience with the lord.

We lost faith, oh in the arms of love

I fall in love just a little, oh little bit

I fall in love just a little, oh little bit

There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh little bit

How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh little bit

119,My Life As Ali Thomas,Cordelia,"Waking up to greet the sun

I saw you once your face a tint of gold
I'm kickin' up a dust storm
Diggin' up a love lost
Do you know if I'm still chasing ghost

Cordelia
Cordelia
Oh I'm still holding on
Why have you gone
Gone without trace
Oh I'm still holding on

I see myself standing in the dark
Repeating myself just what I did wrong
I was selfish I know
But you were so cold
It creeps up creeps up
Ah I should have never let you go

Oh little red dress won't you show me what it's like
To pull you under this haze
And lock you deep inside my chest
Let it run through your veins
Like this poison I can't explain
I can't explain
To love and to hold you
Oh these feelings trapped inside my soul
Will ya ever know

121,Mumford & Sons,I Will Wait,"Well, I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way shake the excess

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind freed from the lies

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground, woo

We'll raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you"
122,Trampled By Turtles,Wait So Long,"And I could never pretend that I don't love you
You could never pretend that I'm your man
That's exactly the way that I want it
That's exactly the way that I am

And you call me in the morning with your troubles
Takin' it downtown every night
I could never place the stars at night above ya
I got my hands on the ground and you know I'm right

You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

It's a coffee stained earth ever time it happens
Liven up honey, it ain't that bad
Any afterthought rose to recognition
Like every other coffin that I had

And your buick broke down in Winnemucca
You fall to your knees and you pray to the Lord
Then you take up hope at the politicians:
Nothing happens in this burnt out town anymore

You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

And your hollows on like a frozen freight train
You know that I help you if I can
But I'm just a raindrop in a river
Just a little itty-bitty grain of sand

And you know that I'm doomed to repeat this
With all the bad habits that I've learned
But it's better than your fiber 'n fornication
And all the dirty money that you earn

And you wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long"

Holy light, oh, burn the night
Oh, keep the spirits strong
Watch it grow, child of wolf
Keep holding on

When I run through the deep
Dark forest long after this begun
Where the sun would set
Trees were dead and the rivers were none

And I hope for a trace
To lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound
There was only me and my disgrace

The voice that sings of a forgotten land
See it fall, child of wolf
Lend a mending hand

When I run through the deep dark forest
Long after this begun
Where the sun would set
Trees were dead and the rivers were none

And I hope for a trace
To lead me back home from this place

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

You talk to me like that
You knew I was slowly falling in love with you

And I... ooh

Is the reason that I'm so obsessed with you

When there's more people out there to love
Than people who love you

I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

Now so much I know that things just don't grow
If you don't bless them with your patience
And I've been there before, I held up the door
For every stranger with a promise
But I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
Every morning keeps returning at my window
And it brings me to you and I won't just pass through
But I'm not asking for a storm

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

And yes, I might have lied to you
But you wouldn't benefit from knowing all the truth
I was frightened, but I held fast
I need you now at long last

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

I sure need a lazy summer day
But oh dear, we've gotta stay
Finish all that we needed to say

Now darling if you fall
I'll be there to hold you
'Cause I gave you my soul
Long time ago, long time ago

'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl
'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl

Now hey you, clear your mind
'Cause happiness is all that I can find
But oh dear, we've gotta stay
Finish all that we needed to say

Now darling if you fall
I'll be there to hold you
'Cause I gave you my soul
Long time ago, long time ago

150,Matt Maeson,Cringe,"Lover come over
Look what I Done
I been alone so long I feel like I'm on the run

Lover Come over
Kick up the dust
I got a secret
Starting to rust

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more no more
I said I'm just tired
She said you're just tired

I said I saw you in the water
I said I saw you in the water

Lover come hold me
Heads on the fritz
Body intoxicated feelings comfortably mixed
Lover come hold me
Could you forget?
I got a secret
Digging a ditch

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more no more
I said I'm just tired
She said you're just tired

I said I saw you in the water
I said I saw you in the water

Sweating all your sins out
Putting all your thoughts back together
Oh we just don't blend out
All of my attempts seem to weather

Oh I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?
Oh I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more no more

I wanna know what it feels like to never come back again

I wanna feel the waves crushin' down on heartache
I wanna find the key to the sky and never come back again

I wanna wake my soul, climb the highest mountain
I wanna write my name in the clouds and never come back again

I wanna find my love, lose myself in passion
I wanna love her in my heart and never come back again

I wanna see the end of a world that's rounded
I wanna know what it feels like to never come back again

I wanna ease my mind of all the doubt that haunts it
I wanna run out in the light and never come back again

I wanna see those stars shinin' down from heaven
I wanna know what it feels like to never come back again
I wanna know what it feels like to never come back again"

155,Cobi,Don't You Cry For Me,"Oh, got my hands tied around my back
And time put a rope around my head
And hung from the rafters of my fear
Dark in the eyes
Try and face the world, I can't bear to
My knees hit the ground and my hands start shaking
Old feelings from new faces
A rope on the floor and a poor man hanging
Please help me chop this tree down
Or hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me

I've seen an ocean run away
I'm torn from the truth that holds my soul
I'm down in the grave where I belong
Oh, what a ride
Identified my devil
Wings to the sky on the run from trouble
With my own hands, no shovel
I dug through the ground, now I'm hanging above saying
Please help me chop this tree down
Or hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (when the sun went down)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (it set the sky on fire)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (I saw an angel fly)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved (I never felt so high)
Down by the grave that the law man laid
When the gravel got paved, finally I'm saved
Please help me chop this tree down
Or hold me from underneath
Words never once cut me down
Oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, don't you cry for me"
156,Of Monsters and Men,Dirty Paws,"Jumpin' up and down the floor
My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talkin' trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

So, for a while things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws"
157,Tall Heights,Horse to Water,"The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken
I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold
In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot
I willed the car to start to bring me home to you

Lead me back from the darkness like you do

Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview
To wish back an image of myself I thought was true
So now when colors fade and on that day of days
I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue

Oh and lead me back from the darkness like you do

Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes
Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit
I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken
Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big

But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met
You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago
There was something about you I struggled to forget
My blood was rushing down to you

You were leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse
'Cause you're a wanderer too"
158,Twin Forks,Back To You,"I was young so I forgot
Which was my place and which was not
Thought I had a good shot
I took it right in my eye

Look ahead, look behind
Take another, I don't mind
I, oh, I, oh

Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you

So, put a posey in your hair
Pretend you couldn't give a care
Whistle past the graveyard
Even the dead deserve a song

Let the moon do what she does
She don't need to make a fuss, ah
She don't know she shines for us, oh
Something tells me that she does

Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you, back to you

Time after time, I follow signs
(I know they wind)
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you, back to you

Love, lower your eyes
Leave me a sign

Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you, back to you

I trust the signs so I may find my way to you
Back to you, back to you
Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you"

160,The Lumineers,Flowers in Your Hair,"When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
It takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And how we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured

'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one
To being ignored

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes ai yai yai
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late 'cause you're attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes ai yai yai
And be in my heart"
161,Ben Howard,Old Pine,"Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags, 
I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone beat down on bony backs
So far from home where the ocean stood 
Down dust and pine cone tracks

We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog where all around us 
The bloom of summertime

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags, 
I've come to know the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone 
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls now.

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.

We grow, grow, steady as the morning
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, steady as the flowers
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still"

No I can't bear to see this die
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
I've used all my farewells

You've been seeing her
With her pretty eyes
And her lovely lies
And I've been waiting here
I've been killing time
Hoping you will be mine
Darling I should've said goodbye
Before you even caught my eye
No I can't better see this die
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
I've used all my farewells

You have used all your farewells

Moving slowly through westward water over glacial plains
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me

And now breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in-between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in-between

You and I, there's air in-between

Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth without thinking of you
Learn to talk and say whatever I wanted to
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my I thought it was a dream

169,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothin' we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now, wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary

I will choose what I believe

Hold on, darling
This body is yours,
This body is yours and mine
Well hold on, my darling
This mess was yours,
Now your mess is mine

Your mess is mine

See you in the marketplace
Walking 'round at 8 A.M.
Got 2 hours before my flight
Luck be on my side tonight

You're the reason that I feel so strong
The reason that I'm hanging on
You know you gave me all the time
But did I give enough of mine?

Hold on, darling
This body is yours,
This body is yours and mine
Well hold on, my darling
This mess was yours,
Now your mess is mine

Bring me to your house
And tell you sorry for the mess
Hey, I don't mind
You're talking in your sleep
Out of time
Well, you still make sense to me
Your mess is mine

Your mess is mine
This body's yours and this body's mine
Your mess is mine"
180,Of Monsters and Men,Mountain Sound,"I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I had caused with my two hands
Alone we traveled
Armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

We sleep until the sun goes down
We sleep until the sun goes down

We sleep until the sun goes down

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran

Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran
Deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now
We sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods we ran"

182,Boy & Bear,Southern Sun,"In all you've seen
Was it that came down on me that night
A conjuring, I held on to that moment and lie
Just to make it alive

I stood out there in the covering
In the baskings of a holy night
Oh I was lucid and conscious
And hovering like a firefly

My mind stretched out on the canopy
It put its arms out slow
I heard the whispers of silence
Floating down from the radio

So come on, come on, I'm ready now
I got that feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul

I saw the light from a kettle gun
Sixteen days under a southern sun
And there were times when I thought that
I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there

You wouldn't believe me if I told you so
The things I saw, were enough to make the man in me
A man of me, make a man of me

So come on, come on, I'm ready now
Go get your things out honey let's get ready to roll
Oh I can feel a wave coming over me
I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go

As a child I was wonder eyed
At the thought that I might know
A life in the ecstasy of Rock 'n' Roll

Oh I'm not taking it slow
I'm an arrow in a bow
Oh you think that I don't know
What it is that makes it glow

So come, come on, I'm ready now
I got that feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul"
183,Mumford & Sons,Little Lion Man,"Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep little lion man
You're not as brave as you were at the start

Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
Waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I my dear?
Didn't I my...

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble little lion man
You'll never settle any of your scores

Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else
Spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I my dear?

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I my dear?

184,First Aid Kit,My Silver Lining,"I don't want to wait anymore I'm tired of looking for answers
Take me some place where there's music and there's laughter
I don't know if I'm scared of dying but I'm scared of living too fast, too slow
Regret, remorse, hold on, oh no I've got to go
There's no starting over, no new beginnings, time races on
And you've just gotta keep on keeping on
Gotta keep on going, looking straight out on the road
Can't worry 'bout what's behind you or what's coming for you further up the road
I try not to hold on to what is gone, I try to do right what is wrong
I try to keep on keeping on
Yeah I just keep on keeping on

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road

I've woken up in a hotel room, my worries as big as the moon
Having no idea who or what or where I am
Something good comes with the bad
A song's never just sad
There's hope, there's a silver lining
Show me my silver lining
Show me my silver lining

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road

I won't take the easy road
The easy road, the easy road

I won't take the easy road
The easy road, the easy road

Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on"

To come on all promising, like the spring

Where, where is the heart in here
Down to the river to silence me
Love took me down to the river to silence me (x5)

My love took me down to the river to silence me
And when he left, I could not speak
I lay on the ground, I tried to scream
But no sound did come out, I could only bleed blue
I waited for him 'til the frost did come
My skin, it turned blue and my body was numb
But my heart, it burned out 'til there was no more
Still I wait on the ground, I don't know what for
There, there is a heart in me
Where, where is the heart in me

This love's killing me but I want it to
So long you're gone just like I always knew
But I'm still here waiting for you
Here, waiting for you

My love took me down to the river to silence me
And when he left, I could not speak
What he said to me, I can never say
Because it's breaking my heart 'til this very day
There, there is a heart in me
Where, where is the heart in me

This love's killing me but I want it to
So long you're gone just like I always knew

No surrender, no retreat
I will tear down every wall
Just to keep you warm
Just to bring you home
I will burn this city down for a diamond in the dust
I will keep you safe and sound when there's no one left to trust
Will you take my hand?
We can make our stand

If your world falls apart
I'd start a riot
If night falls in your heart
I'd light the fire
In the dark, when you sound the alarm
We'll find each other's arms
For your love, all you are
I'd start a riot

I will wade through the fire and smoke like sunlight through the haze
I will fight till the flag waves white until my dying days
Through the bombs and blasts
We will take it back

If your world falls apart
I'd start a riot
If night falls in your heart
I'd light the fire
In the dark, when you sound the alarm
We'll find each other's arms
For your love, all you are

I'd start, I'd start a riot

You make me sing ""ooh""

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?

And by the looks of things she may well have done the same,
But I swear I know that face but I don't know her name,
She's the shape of love.

I stir my tea and throw away wet cigarettes,
I watch her shivering through her rain sodden dress,
I know her make up runs and her hair may be a mess,
But she's the shape of love.

I don't ever want the rain to stop,
I don't ever want to leave this coffee shop,
I don't ever want the clouds to part,
'Cause the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.

I only came inside to get out of the wind,
But now I'm here let it blow yeah let it sing,
'Cause I don't know how this ones gonna end or how it may begin,
But she's the shape of love.

I don't ever want the sun to shine,
I don't ever want to leave this one behind,
I don't ever want the summer time to start,
'Cause the shape of loves the only shape that fits my heart.

I don't ever want the rain to stop,

196,Ben Howard,The Wolves,"Falling from high places, falling through lost spaces,
Now that we're lonely, now that there's nowhere to go.
Watching from both sides, these clock towers burning up,
I lost my time here, I lost my patience with it all.

We lost faith, in the arms of love.

Where you been hiding lately, where you been hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately, we've been fighting with the wolves.
With the wolves.
Red tongues and hands.

Falling from high places, falling through lost spaces,
Now that we're lonely, now that we're so far from home.
Watching from both sides, these towers been tumbling down,
I lost my mind here, I lost my patience with the lord.

We lost faith, oh in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately, where you been hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately, we've been fighting with the wolves.
With the wolves.
Red tongues and hands.

We lost faith, in the arms of love."

You knew who I was every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days

Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sent
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh little bit
Every day with someone new

So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind freed from the lies

And I'll kneel down

I'll kneel down
Know my ground, woo

We'll raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

It's a coffee stained earth ever time it happens
Liven up honey, it ain't that bad
Any afterthought rose to recognition
Like every other coffin that I had

And your buick broke down in Winnemucca
You fall to your knees and you pray to the Lord
Then you take up hope at the politicians:
Nothing happens in this burnt out town anymore

You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

And your hollows on like a frozen freight train
You know that I help you if I can
But I'm just a raindrop in a river
Just a little itty-bitty grain of sand

And you know that I'm doomed to repeat this
With all the bad habits that I've learned
But it's better than your fiber 'n fornication
And all the dirty money that you earn

And you wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick

Command me to be well

Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Since we met I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away but I still feel you
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are
Late at night when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you counting sheep
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Now listen here she said
Boy when you know you'll know
And I know

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood"

You knew what was going to happen didn't you
You talk to me like that
You knew I was slowly falling in love with you

And I... ooh

You know it's your neglect
Is the reason that I'm so obsessed with you
And when I asked you your name you said John Wayne
And I guess it's true
'Cause then you shot me down
Doubled over and I hit the ground right in front of you
I guess in the Wild West
It's ok to shoot the pest that's annoying you

And I... ooh

It's easy to fall in love
It's easy to be alone
It's easy to hate yourself
When all your love is inside someone else
It's easy to take it all
It's easy to give it to
When there's more people out there to love
Than people who love you

And I'm already missing the summer
Stockholm's cold but I've been told
I was born to endure this kind of weather
When it's you I find like a ghost in my mind
I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

Now so much I know that things just don't grow
If you don't bless them with your patience
And I've been there before, I held up the door
For every stranger with a promise
But I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
Every morning keeps returning at my window
And it brings me to you and I won't just pass through
But I'm not asking for a storm

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

And yes, I might have lied to you
But you wouldn't benefit from knowing all the truth
I was frightened, but I held fast
I need you now at long last

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June

217,James Bay,Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"

Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

All right bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year

Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?

I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna

I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger

Never grow to see the pearly gates - break
Every time a bullet detonate - dates
Of obituary carry crates of a scary picture
With a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinnin' you was hearin' angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, comin' from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed
Take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas, that neglect, your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step, step my nigga
One, two, skip, skip
Back, back, look both ways
Pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dawg
It ain't nothin' but a bunch of fuck niggas dawg
In a minute everybody gon' be winnin'

See whites, blacks blazing a pound, ju-jumping around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
B-b-b-bounce from the ground
High for the sound
This verse straight from the morgue
Pop, pop, pop down from the floor
Bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
""Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""

Kendrick Lamar:
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Wake your punk ass up
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah
Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah
How we do?

Kendrick Lamar:
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my mama's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice

MC Eiht:
G-yeah
Cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixing shit since the eighties, loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand

Kendrick Lamar:
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn
You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for?

Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks,
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp,
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L.A.,
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Remember?

Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us

These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line,"" ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got

I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But that's was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck wit' us and we don't fuck wit' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, ""You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help""
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear y'all just wastin' y'all breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'mma make it last forever,
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

Hoe, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, needles it
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch

All Me. All Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking all that kush all in our section like its legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm less than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, touching they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-through
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do."

Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me

Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause

To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard?

255,J. Cole,A Tale of 2 Citiez,"Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not, last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command"
256,J. Cole,No Role Modelz,"First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil

Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters

One time for a nigga who know

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back, nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you. If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was all for a sec now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three

Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together

They tryna compromise my condom size
So I snapchat that whole shit
Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See 3 POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled

A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"

Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99 nigga (Guess who's back?)
Still, still doin' that shit, huh Dre? (Oh for show)
Yeah (Check me out)

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was the Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my gang
Still puffin' my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (for show)
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

Dr. Dre:
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep
Wake up in the AM compose a beat
I bring the fire till your soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and AK-matics
Swap meets, sticky green and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D.R.E.

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether your coolin' on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin' love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbecue's every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

Snoop Dogg:
Right back up in ya motherfuckin' ass, nine-five plus four pennies
Add that shit up, D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog, no stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks
Some of that real sticky icky icky, ooh wee
Put it in the air, oh, you's a fool D.R."

(Oh oh you mad, huh?)
Oh oh, she gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right?
Wanna catch that cab, right? Take back that bag, right?
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse
I'm back on my Chicago shit and this ain't what you want. Shout out to Lil Durk
I'm the villain, no really I'm just chillin'
Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'
Mary, Mary all I need, pussy, money, weed
And all my women in doubles, I'm at the DoubleTree
All I hear hoes callin' out wildin', on the road like every day
We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say
No questions, no questions please, just on your knees
Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe
Gasp, on the gas, till I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed
All praise to Allah, not Ramadan but these bitches fast
Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then skrr
Who her? I forgot her name
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody

There go another lawsuit
In court so much, man I should've went to law school
Everybody brawlin', it was all cool
Till I hit the bartender with the bars-tool
I don't fuck with fake dudes wearin' fake trues
I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, ""tru""
I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes
I'm talkin' Montell Jordan, this is how we do
Bust a nigga head and then I lay low
These niggas ass-water, get the Drano
She ain't really bad, she a photo thot
I should hire this bitch, she so damn good at Photoshop
That Lexapro got me drowsy than a heart attack
I think they finally think they got me where they want me at
I got seven hundred emails in my inbox
What that mean? I ain't callin' nobody back
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody

(Oh you mad, huh?)
(Oh you mad, huh?)
(Oh oh you mad, huh?)
I be catchin' too many stares this evening, God fearin' but God knows I'm on a roll
At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like a corner store
Ain't my fault you ain't the man, made a plan, man it was planned
They sleeping on me like long flights, I pop a Xan on the way to France
Paparazzi like, ""oh that's him!"", pour that gin, let's get faded
Drinkin' like it's no tomorrow, what's today? I'm in the Matrix
Hater, please let me live my life, swear to God I be tryna do right
But if she bad I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
Uh, y'all pay the price, I pay the difference, it's just different
Save money, ain't nothin' different, gunshots and jumpin' fences
Hold on I'm tryna get loose, please don't get shit confused
Ask Don C, I've been lit, this 'Ye shit just lit the fuse
Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet (sshhh)
Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'?
Like I was laying on my arm I'm on my side
South side, I'm down to start a riot
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody

They gon' go Tony Montana and then cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you your man's just some wastemens
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I'm the king

I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it loud like Jamaican here
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence, why we even got to take it here
Why we even got to play these games
Run up on me catch a facial hair
It's the Chasers what you thought
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie no squealie can't talk to the cops that's illegal
I was like Rich Porter no double crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit
Ya that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter like Jordan we back on that bull shit

I can shoot a BB through a frosted Cheerio
From fifty yards away, I can ride blades
I can make it rain even on a sunny day
At the Days Inn, still play to win
I can buy a Benz even if I ride a Schwinn
Twenty inch rims, man that shit's too small
Met this bitch at the mall, ass like two volleyballs

Circle make a square fool, on August 5th
Banana bird fists looks like panda piss

Walking 'round town, rock twenty K below
Hyper color chain with the similac flow
Rocking all this snow, might freeze a rainbow

Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them

I told you we get money, 'bout to peel out
I told you half of these niggas we be winning

Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done"

Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

Fall back shooter like KD
Back in the kitchen with the Curry
Pullin' up wit Xan, can't hurt me

Styrofoam cups servin' patients
Heard you been talkin' 'bout the kid
Knowin' damn well that's a flagrant (technical)

Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the six
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong

Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her
Top rope, I might just seen her
Got in a nigga, aye, no meal

Ninth grade I was serving quarterpound
Trap rules, nigga scrap, jugging pounds
Make them move it like John Cena
Catch a nigga bitch while I'm eating
Diamonds on my neck, blinging
In the phantom opera leaning
Two double cup got me feigning
I dream of genie bitches in bikinis
They dreaming for the fettuccine
Pull up and drop my top off like Houdini
Giuseppe's on my feet, some foreign zebras
Motor fitted, dabbing in the Lee
Sit ya ass down like I'm Beanie Sigel
What's crackin', crippin' nigga, twisting fingers
Longway and Thugger jump in the nina
I slip in your club with the forty and nina
Look at his head call it buzzle bee
Smoking OG Moon Rocks that I mix with the Diesel
Gavanchi walking on the stars
Look at these bitches, just eat it up
Choke on the dick, she just clean it up
Pull up in a fuckin' Bentley truck
Longway bitch"

Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place

Nat Turner would be so proud of me

Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized

Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here

(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chess board
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys?
That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
I'm getting neck from a broad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And I break orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me

Better talk shit

Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
Yeah right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)

Listen man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth

With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic

Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream

Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command"

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, 'cause niggas say they the one

My inhibition's fighting my intuition, premature premonition
...Showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n' Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim 2-6, and fuck it, if the shoe fits
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved"
461,Drake,Legend,"When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin' legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God

You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga

463,Kendrick Lamar,The Blacker The Berry,"(They want us to bow) Everything black, I don't want black
(Down to our knees) I want everything black, I ain't need black
(And pray to a god) Some white, some black, I ain't mean black
(That we don't believe) I want everything black

Everything black, I want all things black
I don't need black, I want everything black
I don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I ain't own black, I want everything black

Six in the morn, fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watching you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or something, but, homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fucking evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guarding my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, making a killing
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, me gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watching me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar, bitch, how can I help you
How can I tell you I'm making a killing
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, me gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, I'm sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy little justification
I'm African American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fucking Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French, but fuck you, no fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinking maliciously, he get a chain, then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefing with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State Marcus Garvey got all the answers
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me

They gon' go Tony Montana and then cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you your man's just some wastemens
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I'm the king
I should probably just move in to Graceland
Madonna's is a ting I know it and I'm the king of pop

I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it loud like Jamaican here
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence, why we even got to take it here
Why we even got to play these games
Run up on me catch a facial hair
It's the Chasers what you thought
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie no squealie can't talk to the cops that's illegal
I was like Rich Porter no double crossing on my peoples

I'm back on that hood shit
Ya that wish you would shit

Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Waking up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that
Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back
Like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Got to leave from the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh
Just stop, stop, stop
'Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even got to drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting.
T's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355.
Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight

Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it Imma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about
What I pray about, check it uh yeah
Got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night
Selling crack to my own pops
Pushing this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Get down and lay down
Hit you with the Beretta and you better stay down
Straight shots on the playground
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given
Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them
Show me the enemy and Imma hit em
The second I bit 'em I get 'em and hit 'em with the venom
Ain't no need to pretend Imma never do it
I knew it, all ready been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related"

I don't have no patience unless it's patients from playing operation
I'm castrating anybody that's hating
I ain't tryna be famous
I'm just tryna make payments from what I'm making
I'm frustrated, 'bout to go Super Saiyan
And I'm causing mayhem when I rap
I got a coffin in the back
And if you talking then the coffin's where you at
I'm sick, I be coughing on the track
I'm exhausted from the raps
I'm tryna kick it with a broad that's on the map
Shit, make her squirt like the hole that's in the dolphin on his back
I gotta be cautious on the track

Killing shows without rehearsal

They committed to my lyrics, that's a verbal
Copying everything that I do but you paternal
Pissing on them like a urinal
I been popping like a kernel
I cut everyone out the circle
The only one who's in it like a gerbil
You spoiled niggas is looking kinda curdled (sheesh)
Crafted the style, these young rappers is jocking it
Made a brand, everything I wear, they be rocking it
Only difference is, I ain't copying it, I ain't washing it
I'm rocking it then throw it in the moshpit and watch it get crazy
They be boxing and tryna knock them, acknowledge it
These rappers is garbage, they all lacking confidence
Fishing for compliments, Futuristic predicting dominance
Since I was six and I was still out spitting to college kids
Fuck boy, you a bitch nigga
Leave your face Will Smith off of Hitch, nigga
Couldn't resist to write a diss

I make dollars, you make cents, nigga
Get ate like chips and fish sticks, ya bish, that's Kendrick
Hit your bitch like Chris did, coming at my neck
You gon' get removed like a cyst, nigga

I been working hard, long days and cold nights
I been traveling, I been up on them flights
I been writing flows, dedicating my life
Lost that love I had, now I'm feeling all right
When my grandma passed I was up on the stage
I said, ""goodbye"", then I lost my way
Been through it all just to get me here and I'm staying

They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called to collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up but I did not give up
'Cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game Philly as shit
Look at these rappers they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em because I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose came up from nothing
And now they like how he make millions so quick
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca
No way

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game till Fox be on
Seeing then momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Steady moving on these niggas get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Y'all looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent I was too far behind
Fuck 'em two at a time, fuck 'em two at a time

Tell me them lies that you want me to hear

Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can

Take 'em back to the 90s!

(Verse 1: Logic)
Okay, now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take them back to way back when like Dennis, The Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

(Verse 2: Big Lenbo)
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus
Flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, ooh-ah
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph, I sign them titties in crayon
Like goddamn
It's me and B-I-G-L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal
Eat wack MCs like Hannibal
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

(Verse 3: Logic and Big Lenbo)
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Baretta, you know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
The Return of the Jedi, bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is overduePass me the fifth and I'm comin' through
The B-I-G-L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that, nigga
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just 301 reppin', second I step in Maryland
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib and tell them bitches to bill us
We the illest
Finger fuck a critic, shit is darker than The Chronicles of Riddick
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on"

You fuck bitches and get money, that's wassup
It's all good, but all these people do not give a fuck
And now I bet they bitchin' cause my flow switchin'

Can't they just be happy I no longer have to face eviction?
That I'm livin' out my life, I'm livin' out my inner vision right now
I be on my Big L braggadocios rap shit

487,The Game;Kendrick Lamar,On Me (feat. Kendrick Lamar),"Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no

Back when Dot was hangin' at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day

Back when my drivers license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I'm well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest All my king stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my deja vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets
Know we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, ""Drive by it,"" I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga it's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!

Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella

There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like what's up 'cause
(Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, ""Just keep your hand on the brick""
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that...

Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype

So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

I chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
I be tryna change my life, but a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
(Skrrr, skrrr) All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God
Soon as the floor hits my feet I'm getting high
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K (And I'ma keep it one-hund' though)
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

Slidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi
And I'm pourin' up the round then I'm sippin on Remy
I ain't fuckin' with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny
Pull up to the back, black Zac, chief rockin'
And the Feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the '49ers
Bite downnnn, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doin' 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
50 chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak
I remember totin' .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly
Nah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'

Woke up in the hills this morning
Asking myself, how did I get here this morning?
Vonte Parker in that teal and orange
And Russell in that gold and purple
Youngest from the Ville, imported
I used to sit up in my room and ponder
Finished school and get a Doctors
I'm twenty-two, I gotta get it now
Man who knew he'd have it figured out?
Trapsoul, man, I crack codes
Crack cocaine, that's what we putting out
There fuck niggas saying
Don't forget when you was broke, I was looking out
And some say there's levels to this shit
Damn look at all the levels that I skipped
Feeling like there's a medal I should get
All these haters getting heavy on my dick
Look at my niggas, chasing paper
Getting books with my niggas
How the fuck can people back home say I shook on my niggas
Your two cents ain't working for me
All you niggas sound commercial to me, man
I don't like commercial niggas
Please shut the fuck up before I hurt you
Fuck your feelings
Don't take it personal, it's nothing personal
This a Derby City come up, this a Derby City vertical
First forty-eight, straight murder you

For years and years we waited on this
Living in a place folks didn't know exist
Surprise motherfucker, we up in this bitch
I said I'm back and I'm so much better
I'm so, so much better
And I won't stop (Louis)
I can't stop
Not now (Louis) not ever (Louis, Louis)

Louis slugger with the hits
Knock them out the park then I'm knocking down your bitch
I'm watching how you pitch
I'm not from Houston, no, I'm not from 'round the six
Got the four series, I should cop the six after the world series
I just taught the rich 'bout palm trees and bad bitches
And how these snakes can harm me with bad business
Damn, fuck out of here nigga
It's very rare for young black men to come up out of here nigga
Some will call it luck and some will call me up
I ain't heard from you in years
Please get the fuck out my ear nigga
My peers get it
Only G-O-D can judge me, fuck the jurisdiction
I'm working, ain't got time for thirsting
Over how these chicks appear in pictures
I'm just painting crystal clear pictures
Brushing up on my lyrics nigga
I just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us
I guess all I ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious

Let's get it
There's not much to say
Woah, I'm from the southside

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody

I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane

Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows

The difference between me and you and gettin' it
See I wanted to when you was four
And this rap game, it get heated sometime
But I thank the Lord 'cause I'm not where I was

Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Pop it up, pop it up, p-p-p-pop it up
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Pop it up, pop it up, p-p-p-pop it up
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump

Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck) give no fuck
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck) give no fuck
Why the fuck my new engine in the trunk?
Skrrt, in the trunk
Tonight I decided I don't give no fucks
(Don't give a fuck, nah) give no fuck
Every single night I bet she down to suck
Met another, 'nother bitch, she down to fuck
Red bone, head the color Tonka truck
Wake up in the morning, up like Donald Trump
Room 22 hit the 69
Started off the 'Tron, I'm off the Henny now
Bitch come through, she know the dealy now
You know where I'm from we get to drillin' now
Side bitch, she tried to tie me up
Got no feelin' now, pop a pilly now
Sell out live shows, Colliseum now
Come and see 'em now
Your main bitch is in my DM now
Talkin' 'bout their problems
Drama, that's TMI"

For real, you the only father that I ever knew

Fulfilled
Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters

Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back, nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you. If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed

How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
25 sittin' on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, imma do it for the Bay

Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay.""
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA

Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her

That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One... time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven... grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit

I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga money talks, and Mr. Ed

I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers

I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

Flex, nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you,
Ah - I'm glad that they chose us
Command, it's a mission,
Trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us,

Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks,
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp,
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L.A.,
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Remember?

Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us

Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it

Cap on, brim bent, Denzel every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cards saying fuck ya life

Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double

Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry
More Louis V, my mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man (Why were you late?)
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him

You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say ""be real"" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Okay, skeet, smoke
Sleep, call
Miss, text
Woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew
Time, kill, months, still
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screamin' till my phone dies
Then she text me like ""why you still talk to my mama?""
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you
Nigga I don't even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I French kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one-eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped pad sch--
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

You ain't pop shit

Man I look up to god
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to god it get so deep though
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean 'cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it
It's written in the stars man the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur
Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter
Nigga that shit just get deep

Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my K
And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre
I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch
Jail time a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen 'cause a broke man is an optimist
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me but it's cool 'cause I never get an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
'Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time, then cross it with pride
That's real my nigga, remember that
And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
'Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime
That shit get deep

Man I look up to god
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep"

You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good southern bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch
In his ear sayin' she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

She knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want
What she want from a nigga
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleeping
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose

She knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well all right
Oh I, oh I-I-I

Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die

Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie

557,Drake;JAY Z,Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,"""Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...""

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
Holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said ""Hov, there ain't many of us""
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

Cake, cake cake cake cake cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda' never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake cake cake
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
Fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

Fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all warned me on
I'm the big homie, they still tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just thoughts that I share with myself
But I thought Fuck It its worth it to share it with someone else more than Paris for once"
558,J. Cole;Miguel,Power Trip,"Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', ""Please play!""
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night"

This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' about girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls and vandalizin' her curls
Sweating her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dawana
Now a nigga only textin' distress over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue about the same thing
Tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing?

(Hook: Missy Elliott)
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey,
But you're perfect for me

We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, name

(Verse 2: J. Cole)
Oh yeah, to my college girl, take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby with your roommates, did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed but the shit together
Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard stories about different dudes
Her man on campus but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like 4-5 niggas,
So you know you gotta multiply by 3

(Hook: Missy Elliott)
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey,
But you're perfect for me

We rollin', we ridin'

I love to go all night and

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Donald Fagen:
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say, ""When you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe

Donald Fagen and Kanye West:
(And hey, hey, hey, hey)
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we lived
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Donald Fagen:
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
When it feel like living's harder than dying
For me giving up's way harder than trying
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhyming
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

Donald Fagen and Kanye West:
(Hey, hey, hey)
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Connie Mitchell:
This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns

You're probably hoping it never would end

Or is it just a one night stand?

Let me see you get high and go low

She like them boy with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old range
I knew her when I rock big old chains
Now the little nigga doing big old things

Would you look at that, I came back for her
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for it
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard

I told her, baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair but

So is life, take a chance, roll a dice
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night

Them boys cool, me I'm on fire
Know what's on my mind, tryna see what's on yours tonight

Tonight, tonight

Get right, get right

Hey, we got a good thing

Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was all for a sec now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God

I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
'Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout' where the Grammy's go
I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I

My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up 'cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I snapchat that whole shit
Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See 3 POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"

Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib
It was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Play some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you were out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catchin' the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like...
Why a nigga can't live? Get this money, fuck these bitches
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pounds
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hope I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Yo 40 I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with me
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100"
564,J. Cole;Kendrick Lamar,Forbidden Fruit,"Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip (boom)
Little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip (uh)
Uh huh

Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect to sip juice
From the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee ""the finisher""
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip (boom)

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All in my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, trying to get that taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home ""baby, don't yell""
How many record do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double X L
Or fader, fuck ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what next the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this the kiss of... death
Blah

Me and my bitch, took a little trip

Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi

Started with a dollar and a dream (and you know that)
Never give a bird bitch a ring (you should know that)
Bitch! Bitch!

Be at all the shows everybody be like, Bitch!

I'm on one
(Get 'em on)
I'm on one
(Get 'em on)
I said I'm on one

I'm getting so cold
I ain't work this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
'Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
'Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8's
Still running with the same niggas till the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink

Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
'Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might as well say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence

566,Drake;Bun B;Lil Wayne,Uptown,"Yeah, Uhuh

(Verse 1-Drake)
Uh hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always resting
And when they call you,
The answer you will hardly question
I... I'm doing classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas situations they are all depressin
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game... you stupid mothasuckas
I see all this 'Money' through my ohio state 'Buck'-eyes
Shit been going good, but good could turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, & I'm about to get her

(Hook-Drake)
It's okay x6
You could run and tell ya friends that I'm on
I'm on x5
Best believe I understand
It's okay x5
You could run and tell my city I'm on
I'm on x5
You could run and tell my city it's on

(Verse 2-Drake)
Yeah, wrong way down a one way
Women don't get saved round me, even on a Sunday
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wondered who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let ya girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth to mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I dropped to black cards, I named 'em Malcolm X & Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just used to 'Love', those are 'Tennis' games lady
Have you counting money going duffel bag crazy
Sippin on Pink Floyd and puffin Wayne Brady
Damn... Whose Line Is It anyways?
I'm in a daze
You been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yep I been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right
You look nice and your frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well all right
Guess I might... know what? Fuck it
Yes I will
I am more that what you bargained for, nothin' less than real
Put it to ya like...

You could run and tell my city it's on

(Verse 3-Bun B)
Bun B, king of the trill also one of the dopest
Rep for the streets or on the mic I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my locc'ness
No joke... it's... time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a py-Thon
That's the type of shit I'm-on
I wrote this on my I-Phone
So let me drop this I-bomb
I-palm the game like it's a Spalding ball-& take flight
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mayne it's gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over, I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Lettermans Late Night
This that major moment you been waitin on for too long
The best that ever did it and doing it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton
So what the fuck is you on??

It's okay x6
You could run and tell ya friends that I'm on
I'm on x5
Best believe I understand
It's okay x5
You could run and tell my city I'm on
I'm on x5
You could run and tell my city it's on

(Verse 4-Lil' Wayne)
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all American bad boy
I own the swagger super market, & you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy
The swag you never had boy
Hate & I will leave your chest the color my flag boy
Suu Woo bitch I do this shit
I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my spoon bitch
I'm so uptown
And muthafucka if you ain't... don't go uptown

And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in... I'ma start shootin in the mosh pit
Haha... fuck is you talkin' bout?
Weezy in ya mouth

It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)

Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know
Buncha' out of season woman fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe
All the rappers that you vouch for need to get out of the house more, they washed up

572,Logic,Run It,"Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming ""Money ain't a thing"", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream meant living out a suitcase
I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money
Run it

What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy this been my house
This is merely an addition, fuck 'em and their permission
They was killin' the game, who the one that gave 'em remission?
You know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget
Second time around shit is different cuh they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating, they can suck my dick
Run it

I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in

Feelin' like Matthew McConaughey on a Interstellar mission
In Chicago at the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people but I take care of the people when I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done, had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn can you feel it? Uh
I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Till I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em, I'm too tied up
This a ransom
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs, off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan
Anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact you should take a step back
'Cause I run it"
573,Logic,City Of Stars,"I know that you think this song is for you
I used to long for you and adore you
My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you
Cause this ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is ""So long""
You did me so wrong for so long, for so long
No I never thought I could live my life without you
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you behind
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
In the city of stars
Where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone
And even life on Mars
In the city of stars
Where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone
And even life on Mars
In the city ...
Cause this ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is ""So long""
You did me so wrong for so long, for so long
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know how I let you...

Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it, I penetrated and innovated
While they emulated, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'mma do it till I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love Hip Hop and I hate Hip Hop
Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sake
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equal
Now let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up
Play the game, run 'em up
Yeah I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real
Guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world, hold that, tell me how it feel
Racism on television and in magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop, shot
And I am finally on top
Too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it
Maryland till I die but I had to get the fuck up out it
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know man, I doubt it"

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop, like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Uh, uh

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)"

From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish

Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish

Go at a reverend for the revenue

Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

Imagine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spillin', pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter and 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands, just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'

Where is she taking me?

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
(That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin')
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in 's lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
(And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too)

Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me

Homey I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

They don't know 'bout me and you

And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies

I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right

Rollin' the Midwest side and out livin' my life getting' out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out fuck that
Imma do just what I want lookin' ahead no turnin' back
If I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall if I die know I lived and missed some bullets

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good.

Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 am, cold sweats wakin' up to the skies
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, 'cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, blaoow

Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibition's fighting my intuition, premature premonition
...Showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! Blaooow

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n' Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim 2-6, and fuck it, if the shoe fits
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved"

I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I'm just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't god as I, make water wine, pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the Ts and dot the Is
Wondering well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, god damn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

But I be good by the weekend
I be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

Mondays I think of you
But I ain't tripping on it
Tuesdays I'm in
Gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you
You know you're staying over
Thursdays I'm sick of you
I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright

My section in the club, Remy, Rose
When you're all ready say go, okay
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop
You see him standing on the furniture doing his thing
Tell the club owner, fuck yo' crouch, Rick James nigga
Pop a bottle, make that thing go blow
Let her drink it till she drown
Let a girl go wild, pop a bottle
Bow, bow, bow...

(T.I.)
Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss
Watch ya gettin' money make it rain buy a bottle
Pop a cork, dork
If I may retort
I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before
I pop bottles but I don't pour
Save the glass for guys, we ballin' on a budget
Fuck it, let your glasses rise
I'm straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised
Ask any hoe who know me, all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes
No subtraction, only cash to divide
We gettin' money, bank roll, supersized
Whether rain, sleet, sunny
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming

(Drake)
Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa
I heard you talk bout other niggas
Them other nigga no matter
The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka
Me and Weezy run this bitch so bring me one soda and vodka
And a fuji for my nigga cause the police probably watching
Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option
We be sunning all these niggas, put there ass up for adoption
And we start with straight shots, that get the bottle poppin'
We be working all night, telethon shit
Roll a super skinny once you you Ne Lemon shit
Ooh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit
You with a lot of dudes, that's that Elton John shit
Ah, to each his own, I like a fruit that's grown
I like a bad bitch from a decent home
Me and Tip, that's that pimpin' that we preachin' on
And everybody tryna listen nigga, speakerphone

(T.I.)
I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me
'Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
Everything brand new, you get money like who?
Spent 150 on my car and my Audemar too
When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you
They see me like ""there he go""
Look at you like ""ah who?""
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take 'em all across your, I ain't finna argue
Still big shit poppin', nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can't go
Can't be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walkin' to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
Fifty stack, I'mma show you how to ball, triple that"

Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine

Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through
(The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won't be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
No more

Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city

I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?

Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, warn you now
Whatever goes up surely, must come down
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man

I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite they tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship

No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
'Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we been off them slave ships

Soldiers all in Al-Qaeda, new Mercades for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet the Navy
Baby seen me in that rave, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and menage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
Till I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she said ""That was just some foul shit""
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence

There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name
I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify
He's right by my side
I believe it be
His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah"
603,Logic;Big Sean,Alright,"Hold up, let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind right
You know everything is all right
You know everything is all

Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucker hold me down
Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas
With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war everybody ain't no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio everyday so you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is all, everything is all right

It's finally famous over everything
Rattpack gang
What up though Logic, yeah
Day one shit right there

Oh my God they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessins away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And I'm blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got champagne problems, and I order more my wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is all right

Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace
No need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach!"

608,Kanye West,Real Friends,"Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good"" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

Saying, “Let it happen, let it happen (it's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen”

Trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside
And all the others seem shallow
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
Must be morning

I heard about a whirlwind that's coming round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

All this running around
I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out
And it's never been closer
If my take-off fails
Make up some other story
But if I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry

I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
You are not thinking that I will not do it
They be lovin' someone and I'm not stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next train

I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it

Hands is on her you know what, 'cause bandz a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast, my pants be on that too much lust
And I'm 'bout whatever baby, take a photo, I'm looking good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you're misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
All of these pussy niggas, only under influenced
Throw a block up then I back out, like that, roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I'ma smack, and a bucket but we nothing but pack
Bald-headed scallywag, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Mark Gasol, or Selby do, that's plenty dough
That's Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those
Ralph!

Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I'm about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)

(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

Turn up...
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy, toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl, doin' a tiny line off of her titty
Ain't tryna fuck, I just found a replacement, feelin' so global, I think I need agent
Ratchet on deck and they know I'm gon' stunt, I'm tryna get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up, I don't know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie, then codeine in a styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin', do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can't fit in my pocket, keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it's back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don't buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Working for that money, bitch, you gon' have to break a sweat
Bounce it

Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I'm about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)

J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line,"" ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot

I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But that's was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck wit' us and we don't fuck wit' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, ""You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help""
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear y'all just wastin' y'all breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'mma make it last forever,
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

Hoe, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, needles it
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch

All Me. All Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking all that kush all in our section like its legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm less than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, touching they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-through

In Adidas with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's

Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like 'nigga' with a hard R
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me

Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like ToeJam

You know these rapper dudes, talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an arch villain
I'm from the south, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di

Yeah, they say they want the realness, rapped about my real life
Told me I should just quit: ""First of all, you talk white.
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah you hate me but you will respect

I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now nigga that's a mixtape!

Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' ""Oww!""

I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy

Said, ""Pull yourself together

The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait 10 years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

I was doing fine without you
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without you
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it

Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now

You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk

Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually

Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza 'cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin' at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want

This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you I already know
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like, woah

Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah

You don't wanna fall in love I know
I'm not someone you should trust I know
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
Burrrrat stick it, b-burrrrat stick it

Thank you, thank's Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired boss"
629,Drake,Views,"Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, thumbing through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either"

Kanye West:
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, ""I love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A., like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

Dwele and Connie Mitchell:
As I recall, I know you love to show off

And they say they ballin? but I do it how the pros do
Where we goin' next? we gon let my hoes choose
No socks and my boat shoes
Guess a n-gga eating good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too
And now I'm into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a b-tch give me brain call it home work
N-ggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work

Alota shit done change
New clothes new car new things
Sayin' boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up that's what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin' no money

Learn to get good show money, that's yo money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich n-gga shit, that really goes for me
Self made n-gga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
Big mistake
I'm too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like ?who is this??
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independence day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My n-ggas keep it real, so I hear what they say

Either you getting paid, or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

(Curren$y)
Uh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You n-ggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
Sweatin bullets at home, wondering if she coming back
? And she she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
We was sneaking in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
Our windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'?
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin? and chillin'
We plooted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
Twit-pic?ing when we get it and they mad at us
F-ck them n-ggas

Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated

I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast

Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower

Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool

Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one

One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife

That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I'm so [x5] proud of you [x3]

Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know who you are

...B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in

Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill

It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel, too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel, too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

H-h-h-he asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guarding?
Double D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I'm so [x5] proud of you [x3]

Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know who you are

And all I can say is
I'm so [x5] proud of you (proud of you)
And all I can say is
I'm so [x4]

It's just amazing, girl, all I can say is

I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna

I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?

I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that

Tell her I apologize, happened over time

If they don't get it they'll be over you

You better do what you're supposed to do
I'm like ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's... true.

Listen to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's how you thinking is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it I don't even gotta say it

I know you thought we had something special
But you don't mean nothing to me
Girl I'm sorry you not the one for me

Just be honest, girl what you want from me?
This ain't nothing new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me

Give hope to my niggas, them niggas blood money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me

Looking for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga taking shots, and I'm back check the postage, yeah

Don't settle for less or for infidelity

Or even keep the business behind his lips like me

Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11

Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through

Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan

Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money till your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that,
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacking, that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not

We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight

You no hear me yet?
Hear me live and direct
Walk with your tap

Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
Cause shit is different now
It's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets
Y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare - I just don't go outside
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday
With a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt
We call that champagne

658,Frank Ocean,Nights,"Round the city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breathe till I evaporated
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust them anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't trying to keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a séance
You were from my past life
Hope you're doing well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

New beginnings, ah
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that ""spend the night"" shit
Kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, everyday shit
(Every night shit)
(Night shit, night shit, night shit)

All my life, been ready for you all my life
Been waiting on you all my life
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my life, you've been missing all my life
Still got some good nights for the memories
And the look back's getting me right

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that K.O.
No white lighters till I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self-made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoneys on occasion
After 'Trina hit, I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that ""spend the night"" shit
Kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Wanna see me bummed out, stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation

659,Lil Wayne;Drake,She Will,"(Verse 1: Lil Wayne)
I tell her ""Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga.""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hairnet

Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap

I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

(Hook: Drake)
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
Told me ""Baby it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal

'Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

(Verse 2: Lil Wayne)
And I tell her ""Go on! Pop that pussy for me.""
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her till she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen

Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
Told me ""Baby it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal

'Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will"

I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty

The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drinking Hen' and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bustin' wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language
I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with

I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away
Baby let me be your vacation
The other chick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin'
Baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space
We can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas?
South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? 'Cause I know you've been going through some things
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
Which your may think that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
(Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...)

The way you move it's like you could use a vacation

661,Post Malone,Go Flex,"Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen to what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check"
662,J. Cole,Trouble,"I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say I live fast, die young, so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first the sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, ""The Things Hoes Say""
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
I take you to the promise land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off of her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""Don't you know this shit already?
Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jumpshot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And theirs man's don't know, man's don't know, fa show
Had a nigga's baby, little man's don't know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
""Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?""
Whoa

I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right

663,J. Cole,January 28th,"The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
You my niggas, and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' 'bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said son
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

670,Drake,Marvins Room,"Hello? Yeah I just walked in.
Yeah I'm good... you still working?
Tonight, right now? Did I go out? Yeah I went out.
I went... I went to a couple of clubs.
I never went to bed, shit... wine or water?
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that imma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry.""

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said ""You niggas crazy.""
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble"
671,Drake,Too Much,"(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Verse 1: Drake)
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out""

(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Verse 2: Drake)
Uh -
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life, I guess."" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

(Hook: Sampha)
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Your heart's done
Your love's done
Don't give up
Don't fake it
Don't have to..."

Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, ""why-you-love-the-strippin-shit""
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all

Saturday nights, off in my bed right now

Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now"
673,Drake,Shot For Me,"I can see it in your eyes: you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it: Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon hear this: I'm the man
Yeah I said it! Bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up: did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in your ear: that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

(Rick Ross - Verse 2)
Ok look: I'm honest
Girl I can't lie: I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
'Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it...

May your neighbours respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you

(Lil Wayne - Verse 3)
Girl you can believer Viacom V Of Doom
I steal not supposed to shit, it's supposed to gems
I'm not to world to be a shit from bitch

Fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always
Fall for your type (for your type)"
674,Drake,Doing It Wrong,"When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

(Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica)"
675,Drake,Over My Dead Body,"How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself ""why do you worry?""
You know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

(Drake - Verse 1)
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

(Drake - Verse 2)
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
'Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together -- I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got 10 years to go huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right"

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up In a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

But who in their right mind is letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girls 100
And I want it, no question
I know destiny well and know I seen the Lord blessing me still

677,J. Cole,Immortal,"Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again, numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears, thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin, nigga put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five

Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA
In that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain

Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on

Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we...

Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up

Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch

For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check 'cause I thought they had their shoes tied together

This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life

Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sing,
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh

I hate rich niggas goddammit
'Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got now the nigga don't paint the same thang.
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dana and Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you're just afraid of change.
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you.
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
'Cause I can't maintain no more.
Tad bit extreme I know.
Money can't save your soul.
But there go you

And there go you
And there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing,
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh

I love my women real tall, ay
Type that can really play ball, ay
You buy my hat at the park, ay
Think I might really play ball, ay
I got a link in my bio, my bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And yeah my momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots

I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama
She sting like a bumble bee, hot as the sauna
She shine like a Rollie, got that from her momma
Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control
And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion, babe oil me
Drinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me

Am I the only one who really care about cover art
Growing up I ain't have my brother 'cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me 'cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit

I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

Told me my mom was a whore

I give a perc full of steam
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and geuss
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can...

Lil Kodak they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
My mama told me, ""Boy make a decision""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil Kodak they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

700,Drake,Wu-Tang Forever,"I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure

How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 A.M. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl

How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing

At least we try for homerun every time

I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe

That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road and the East end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous

Paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder"" again

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like ""damn I was just with him after school""
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
Forty one souls murdered in fifty hours

The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder""
The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder"" again, murder again

Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
Three hundred and fourteen soldiers died in Iraq,
Five hundred and nine died in Chicago

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cous'? It's all black, I love us

The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder""
The paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder"" again,
""Black-on black murder"" again, ""black-on-black murder"" again

It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs

Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough... we gonna need a million more
""Kick in the door"" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go

Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out till we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man and take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie cause ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci, now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor

They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back

They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my...

I'm so hot, yeah, I'm so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

Yeah
It's all Habibis ting, ya?

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Have fans but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?""
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' around
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a hundred fifty thousand dollars for an after party
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fuck with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

Hell nah

Nope, no way, nah

Switch it up would be the last move (Let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (magnet)
You got the going out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (keys)
You got the key to defeat (defeated)

Gettin' loose, off the Henny rock, and a hint of Goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my rollie, told my bitch, ""Let's go snorkelin'!""
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with Jay, but I still send a Tidal wave
(Yeah) I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
It's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake, I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, fuck the fuck-shit, I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I'm stressed
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B out the bracelets

712,Drake,Lose You,"I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

This is the 6's year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we'll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I'm sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit"
713,Drake,Do Not Disturb,"Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep till morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"
714,Drake,Passionfruit,"Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this mothafuckin' record
I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better

Listen, seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Trying to think of the right thing to say"
715,Drake,Teenage Fever,"Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6 AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ"
716,Logic,Bounce,"Living good, I've been living good
Rolling through my hood, understood
Just a younging in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the fame)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the)
We've been at it way before the fame, psyche
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit
No ain't just tryna hit, get, get with this
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue
I'm coming through
If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do
We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame

Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam
They know who I am
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if Imma make it
Man fuck it I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in

Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame

The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel round the atlas in this spaceship candy-coated
My day shift's been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up
Lampin' in Jamaica, the cloud's turnin', my thought's turnin'
Burnin' castor oil, I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but...

More bars, no peers, no scars, no fear, fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers, you know what the risk is
Earth indigenous, ya body reverting to stiffness

726,Kendrick Lamar,DUCKWORTH.,"It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart, that my-

Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier
Hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him
And then let him slide; they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers, and put 'em in random predicaments; give 'em a soul
So they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers
You make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper
Would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

So, I was takin' a walk the other day..."

Come and get your man's
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real-I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, ""Are we straight?""
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

734,Lil Uzi Vert,Canadian Goose,"I woke up in the morning, brush my teeth smack my bitch ass
All I do is think about the cash
Yeah, what, getting all this cash
Yeah, what, I'm 200 on the dash
Lil Uzi ooh, I got hella groupies
Smoking Backwoods I don't fuck with doobies
Copped the double plus 'cause I'm rocking Ksubi's
I fuck with my same hoes I don't trust these niggas
990 that's the nubies ya
Smoked that boy like he is a loosie ya
On the Xan hear a noise I load it up

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

Driving around in a what
Saint Laurent all on my boots
Saint Laurent all on my boo
2000 dollar a tooth
Lil Uzi you is the truth
Lil Uzi you is the truth
If you think they took my chain, boy you is a fool
I said boy you a fool
I just caught me a Mewtwo
I just caught me a Mewtwo
Japanese girls stuck to me just like some glue

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

Diamonds all on my teeth so I barely can talk
Money all in my pockets so I barely can walk
Diamonds they shine in the dark
She from L.A. but she live in New York
But I ain't worried about that
Worried about busting them traps
Lil Uzi ya you know I be smoking that pack
If she gon leave then you know she coming right back
In a Cadillac do a drive by with a mac
When I walk in none of these hoes can relax
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
Came right in put my city on my back
But I'm still so relaxed on a Xanax
I don't care what you did, don't love you less
But its still Margiela all on my vest
What a cross on my neck
I just flew to the A
I might go to M.I.A.
I ain't talking paper planes
On the block with all my chains
Got the money and the fame
You a lame that's a shame

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup"

739,Big Sean;Eminem,No Favors,"Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, ""Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too.""
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America; I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
Though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means, so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing, dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power-how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the GOAT while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes, like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, ""late"" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back, like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle, rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin' 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"" pleading-but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma...

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

Come into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?
We'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn... just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
""Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt""
Yes right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that!

Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger... slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat... believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone"

They don't want no broke niggas
But don't call them gold diggers
I don't know, I don't know, why I ain't get the picture?
Why Cosby slipped her?
Why I fucked 'em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain't have the Magic?
Why AR never want a trip?

And he ain't take me when I got hit?

Nas and Kanye West:
Beyond Pérignon, the fame, the money
The Baccarat crystal that's hanging from the ceilings above me
Hearing people whisper, screaming I'm lucky but trust me
Nothing come free, shawty tried to keep my son from me
Or I could be delirious to take life serious
Remain single forever, can't wife nothing, period
I'm a G, I need privacy, media's never kind to me
Niggas beefing on small time things, we on a dying spree
He disrespected y'all
Just like a nigga, go figure
He talking reckless, yo
I can't accept it, yo
No matter how much I've tried
For the love of my people, I guess I'll let it go
I can't figure it out

No matter how much I've tried

Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask them when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged
Back then if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around

I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down

Ordered her the filet told 'em butterfly it she'll love it
She used to soda and nuggets she really just out here thuggin'

Why we even got to play these games
Run up on me catch a facial hair
It's the Chasers what you thought

So girl, what you singing for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

20, keep the bar rolling
Fake IDs and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign

Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland
Why? 'Cause

Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me

Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

All right bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year

Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?

Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin'
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'

I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go

You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion

I got the truth, me, baby!

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, now a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

I might end up with your hoe if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowadays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I taste (still...)
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe (still...)
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am?
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, ""Boy I think the money startin' to change you""
God save you, save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am

My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I shouldn't have ever gave you a chance (gave you a chance)
I got four lawyer fees, shit ain't ever end
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You with my ex wildin' with different color candies (so familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded

Still comin' out strong
Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness

We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you 'cause

We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music

Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, motherfucker, we rollin'
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So good night, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power

Ooh, fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown-up thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinkin' no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours

Colin Powers, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need yo' pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'

Now this'll be a beautiful death

Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)

Now this'll be a beautiful death

We use to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just levelled up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man it's true, ex's change, yeah
Guess you changed for the better (better)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

For real shawty
Yeah I know

Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
I'ma fuck you over, wanna fuck you over then again the truth
'Cause I ain't really here to start problems
Girl I swear to God though, hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em ""Don't try him""
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise him
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and fourth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass on my grip, college
Make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say wassup witchu? You got my soul"

Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I fucked three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a fuck about what the teacher say, cause either way
I'mma just do me, and she said me too, I said ""s'il vous plaît""
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe

If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back, she asks a million questions

Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one, you knew that

Everything I see up in my head just comes to life
Got my favorite girl waking up in my bed, it's only right
Bad bitch my only type, independent too, get it boo
Just promise me you won't let all the bullshit they say get to you
You a 10, I'm not perfect but for you I do pretend
I've been working 2 to 10, that's AM
Ain't nobody quite like him, put in the time like him
I've been grinding for a while now it's feeling like my time is finally here
That's ideal, that's ideal, that's ideal

Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
'Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one, you knew that

I've been doing great I guess I can't complain
I don't think about yesterday
Every move is calculated, this shit ain't no guessing game
Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that second base
How many come ups until it's destiny
How many come ups until it's meant to be
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't shit to me, same dude, different dream
This is me (This is me)

Ain't nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go
Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know
'Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing, at all
Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know

Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
'Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up

Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own
God Bless the woman that can hold patron
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached, like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you is clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldn't judge a n-gga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out

Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it""

Pass out, drank, wake up, drank

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most till someone said to me

""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Aw man (Sherane)
Where is she taking me?
Where is she taking me?

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
(That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin')
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in 's lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
(And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too)
Wait hold up, ay I see somebody

Aha, got them niggas, K-dot, you good?

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed

How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
25 sittin' on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, imma do it for the Bay

Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay.""

Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter

That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One... time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven... grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit

I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga money talks, and Mr. Ed

I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers

I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play

There sure ain't nothin' iller
Man I'm a lady killer, if I want her I'mma steal her
I promise I could make her fly away like caterpillars
So if you don't know by now then you should probably get familiar

I been through like a hundred cities
Signed a thousand titties, I'm talkin' millions of bitties
I'm a dog, I chase that kitty, if your girlfriend is pretty
Chances are I'm tryin' to snatch so I could slay and take her with me
Bro I'm the man, did you not know that?
Your girl want me to take a picture with her on her Kodak
And you're so whack, she knows that
I be where the coke and smoke at
See her friend and now I'm going for that three like I'm Steve Novak
Don't be mad at me if she leaves
You should always know not to fuck around with thieves
She just wants to kick it with some g's
Smoke some trees, pop some p's, later she'll be on her knees
And I'm gone
So if you really want her for your own
Be worried if I show up on her phone
You don't want to leave the two of us alone
'Cause I'mma probably taker her somewhere soon to bone

Hoodie, oh jeez, goddamn, look at all my followers
Bitches ride the wagon, but I'd rather give her cholera
Many look at me like I ain't even got a fuckin' plan
All right, that's 'cause I'm the fuckin' man
Yo girl on some Romeo and Juliet
'Cause she would rather kill herself than ever be with you again
So I swoop in and tell her, if her parents don't approve of me
That don't change a goddamn thing, girl, I don't buy no jewelry
Never spendin' money on a necklace
Or a bracelet, let's just face it, like you better when I'm wasted
And you like me when I'm stylin', stylin' but I'm deadly
Me and G some lady killers, let me start the medley like, hello (Hi there)
And please don't put your number in my phone (Don't do that)
'Cause I might text you after all of this patron (My bad)
It tends to help me out when I'm feelin' alone
But I don't wanna go, I don't, I don't wanna go"

No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me one time shame on you

Pockets on a chubby chick
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (OOOUUU)
Yerr Eli, why they testing me?
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me?
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me?
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame?
If that's your chick, then why she texting me?
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressing me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie
I don't open doors for a whore
I just want the neck, nothin' more
Shawty make it clap, make it applaud
When you tired of your man, give me a call
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw
Next minute calling for the law
This nine will have them calling for the lord
They ain't getting shmoney so they bored

They say I got the juice, I got the sauce
These haters on my body shake em' off

If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Oh, don't double charge for me for that
Oh, don't double charge for me, we like
Oh, don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Verse the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'mma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...

Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign

Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland
Why? 'Cause

Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made history

Tell them imma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah

855,Big Sean;Drake,Blessings,"Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up

I live the life I deserve, bless
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was all for a sec now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
'Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout' where the Grammy's go
I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up 'cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I snapchat that whole shit
Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See 3 POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"

I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty

The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drinking Hen' and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bustin' wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit

I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space
We can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas?
South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? 'Cause I know you've been going through some things
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
Which your may think that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)

862,Drake,Headlines,"I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floating in and out on consciousness

And they say that I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?

I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't wanna problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that

No, don't do it, please don't do it
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money
So Drizzy gon' pay it

They know, they know, they know, yeah

I be yelling out
Money over everything
Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake, girl don't tempt me

If they don't get it they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you're supposed to do
I'm like ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's... true.

Listen to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's how you thinking is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it I don't even gotta say it
They know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know

Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys

Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' 'cause I be so official

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and yo daughter gots special thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine and if I'm blind, fine
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it, need some knee
Pads, it happened for a reason, one can't be
Mad, so know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school
And graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
(Uh, uh, yeah)
I apologize a trillion times

“Look at the way he treats me”
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
You got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And then you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Talking about jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating, beating, and to the G they be the same thing
So who you be placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Oh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye
But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

You are unforgettable
I need get you alone

Now you wanna chose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me

I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Oh oh, You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you
You don't know, so pick up that dress for me
You rest on me
Too much combo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So as long you never hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your body

You are unforgettable
I need get you alone

Now you wanna chose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

Right now
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody

Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you going
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard

You got everything to give right now

Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know
Like I won't be here long, now the thrill is gone

Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones

""My God, you pay for your friends?""
I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies
Why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)

Sorry, I'm just scared of the future

I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore

I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame
We blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine
Or leave it like Cobain

And when I'm long gone
Whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a lambo like Lebron's mom

And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so

Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin

Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up

Baby hold up, I can kill your migraine

Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know, he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40
I am a rap legend, just go ask the kings of rap
Who is the queen and things of that nature
Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a lazer
Trippin' on that work, trippin' off that purp
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all that D
'Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this

Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin

I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga

For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't

I'll put my leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important

And they never will

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
You're like oh well
You're like fuck it oh well
My past behind me like a pony tail

But you're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you

And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

Ok I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
'Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more henny and you're past the limit
You told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for ""Finisher""
So misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature

It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration

Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy

Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end

Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt

Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these muthafuckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya

Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball till they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do

If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on

Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda

Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for

Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause

To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

If you really want some smoke, you can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make a nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Sazón, I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club till the end, from the spot
You know me, Cardi B, pussy poppin' on the charts

If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

Fuck with me and get some money, yeah ay

Shots fired at my sprinter bus, bap bap bap, graow
Nobody got hit, it was ten of us
Touch down at Coachella and they pulling up
Pick up the vector, then I point it up
Start busting, ain't no need to load it
I hit the gas, take out their expedition truck

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

Man down, where you from, nigga?

Wake your punk ass up
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah
Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah
How we do?

Kendrick Lamar:
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my mama's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice

MC Eiht:
G-yeah
Cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixing shit since the eighties, loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand

Kendrick Lamar:
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

M.A.A.d city

Born and raised on the Zone 3

Pull out the stick if you 'bout that life

Run down, catch a nigga by sundown
Or downtown when he think the shit is serene
Got that boy when they shot that boy
Then they put him in the trash when they slide by the Beanz
Swerve, soon as I peel off the curve
Burn the evidence then a nigga hide

I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me
Telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking
Like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me

It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good"" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him

Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', real life goals

They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Watch me break the money machine till her clothes fall
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo

I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapos servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

She's a good teaser
And we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby

Slim Jxmmi, I got a lot of flavor
Fifteen hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I got haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player

I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the 80's
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a little sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Petty nigga pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my card

I sit back and read, like Cat in the hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
Till a nigga get killed
Till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'm a at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating""
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians

Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Petty nigga pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my card

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin', like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?

1020,Wiz Khalifa,The Race,"The World turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some will say that life's a bitch
Well I'ma flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases
Old folks jock my car 'cause they know just what this is
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' then what you call that
Nothing but net, ain't back 'cause I never left.
I did everything right nigga better yet
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us
Something like a contractor building from the ground up
Now just
Twist up this weed
Realize that you are in the presence of a G
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean

I'm riding round, smoking good, music so loud
Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

I'm in a race, and taking the winners place
No foot on the brakes
One the best, homie that's what they call me
It's lonely at the top, got no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's
My dime piece only recognise the best tree's
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe
You in her face, I let her breath

From debated on, to waited on
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on
'Cause we are, Young Movie stars
'Cause we are, Young Movie stars

(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

O-ooh-oh, now I just stunt on my own
Bitches ain't say shit to me but now they won't leave me alone
Used to walk the other way
But now they all come to my home
And they calling my phone, cause my paper was looong
Nothing, they ain't singing my song
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along
We flying up, now you want me to take it all off
Want me to take it all off

Tell a bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star
'Cause we are, young, gifted, not to mention out here making muthafucking millions
Yeah, I said it, muthafucking millions
Got my money up, I'm in the building"

And they say they ballin? but I do it how the pros do
Where we goin' next? we gon let my hoes choose
No socks and my boat shoes
Guess a n-gga eating good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too
And now I'm into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a b-tch give me brain call it home work
N-ggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work

Alota shit done change
New clothes new car new things
Sayin' boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up that's what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin' no money

Learn to get good show money, that's yo money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich n-gga shit, that really goes for me
Self made n-gga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
Big mistake
I'm too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like ?who is this??
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independence day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My n-ggas keep it real, so I hear what they say

Either you getting paid, or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

(Curren$y)
Uh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You n-ggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
Sweatin bullets at home, wondering if she coming back
? And she she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
We was sneaking in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
Our windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'?
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin? and chillin'
We plooted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
Twit-pic?ing when we get it and they mad at us
F-ck them n-ggas

Bounce for the crown
Fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow
Every once in a while
I see hands in the crowds
See whites, blacks blazing a pound, ju-jumping around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
B-b-b-bounce from the ground
High for the sound
This verse straight from the morgue
Pop, pop, pop down from the floor

She knows how to back it up and drop it down
She knows, she wants all the fellas looking at her
'Cause they know as soon as our song come, it's a wrap

Does she love the attention?
Does she get it when she moves?

Showin' out with her homegirls
Hypnotizing all the dudes

She knows
She knows
I know, I know, she knows
And I know, I know, she knows

She bad mixing ratchet with the classic girl
So bad, I just couldn't let her pass me
I told her, shawty
You so right, but you so wrong
She said, daddy, I'll be back after this song
Then you're taking me home

She loves the attention that she get when she move
Showin' out with her homegirls
Hypnotizing all the dudes

She knows
She knows
I know, I know, she knows
And I know, I know, she knows

She loves the attention that she get when she move
Showin' out with her homegirls
Hypnotizing all the dudes

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

I chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
I be tryna change my life, but a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
(Skrrr, skrrr) All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God
Soon as the floor hits my feet I'm getting high
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K (And I'ma keep it one-hund' though)
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'

Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

Slidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi
And I'm pourin' up the round then I'm sippin on Remy
I ain't fuckin' with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny
Pull up to the back, black Zac, chief rockin'
And the Feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the '49ers
Bite downnnn, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doin' 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
50 chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak
I remember totin' .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly
Nah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

My life is more effective than a cocaine drop
'Cause I was trappin' at Grandma's house when I came out
I said ""Fuck the streets"" and made my own lane now
When you get high enough, you can dodge raindrops
And tell your momma and your daddy you in a gang now

You know that niggas full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas full of tries, oh, oh
You know that niggas full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
Just so you know, I need you to know how to use me
Tell me what you're usin' me for

Use me to make me better
Oh, yeah you can use me
Use me, then use me
Then you better, then you better
Use me
Use me...
Use me..."

When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

I was sober for an hour but I'm rollin' off a bean now
The drugs, they give me confidence, I'm sayin' what I mean now
The xannies help me slow up, the lean it help me speed down
Ballin', yeah I'm ballin', I won't hit it if she beat now
Callin', yeah she callin', your bitch got me on the speed dial
Driving through the Rex I look at faces don't see no smiles
It's grimy in the 6, who can I trust? I'll never know now
Sprite is extra dark now, my doggie in the dog pound
They say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down
See me doin' good, they start to hate, that's how it goes now
I don't know why they mad at me, I always stay ten toes down
Drivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am

I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

I remember being a kid my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit
Diamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick
Never had no help so don't approach me on some free shit
Did this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

Lit late night on this side
You never come around past midnight
You miss everything on this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side
I made a lot of money on this side
Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Clearly I've been thinking about this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back what's been mine
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feeling of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs had to get right
If I could get my partner back it would be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side
This side, this side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side

Young rich nigga from the north side
Paid my dues on this side

I made it out the hood I'm on the other side
All my niggas on this side
Keep it one hundred on this side
Love to get money on this side
No new niggas on this side
Look at my diamonds don't get blind
You better handcuff you ho with a zip tie (cuff!)
I will take a busta down on this side
Broke niggas stand to the left side
Handsome and Wealthy on this side
I came from the bottom and now I'm on top that's phenomenal
This side, this side, this side, this side
If I do not make it I wonder where I will go
This side, this side, this side
Graduated from the midget
This the life I was living
Graduated to a million
It's the money that I'm getting
Graduated from a hotbox now I ride around in a Bentley
How we do it on

This side, this side, this side
Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side
That's right, that's right
You ever come around that's midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know how I like my lean, po' up

We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought

Bitch I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

I called a contractor to make me a Sprite
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Have these bands on me, I'mma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Got a porter, the cash can't even stay in the house cause there's too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent I was too far behind
Fuck 'em two at a time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at
Niggas, no, I ain't lying, niggas, no, I ain't lying
There's a lot on my mind, there's a lot on my plate

I put some free bands in her account
I told her ""bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put the hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking the styrofoams up by the door
They don't let me back in, they ain't know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I'm working on having some manners
I'm thinking about it right now
I'm holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived

Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time

I'm in Fifs with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds around my neck no flugazy
Bad bitches in the suite, trying to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the Styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bands on Al Capone
And my cash way long, (turned up)
I see a bunch of clones

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in Pluto I'm in Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time

Give me an apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga servin' jays outside crim
Jump across from me you know your chances slim
In my Aviator Gucci, like I'm driving planes
Flyin cash in cash money, smell like cocaine
Doin' Birdman numbers, makin' flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop a bail on ya rinng
Spent so much at Louie gave me free champagne
In Bel Harbor shoppin' and they doing the same thang
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I check a Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the sae damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time"

Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it""

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most till someone said to me

""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Where is she taking me?
Where is she taking me?

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
(That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin')
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in 's lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
(And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too)
Wait hold up, ay I see somebody

Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a different crew every weekend
You, don't wanna dap back, keep sleeping

Yeah, you wished for it, me, I worked for it
Everyone passed on me like Kurt Warner
A search warrant needed, your career went missing
This ain't overnight, this is year ten visions
Peers listen and they know that I'm up next
That's your girl? Why she always does what Russ says
Success is something that I'm blessed with mentally
I got plaques for my raps and my melodies
Can't forget about the beats too, I'm the best kept secret
Real shit affection, pledge your allegiance
I was gone for so long, now I'm on though
Bitch I'm talking, don't you interrupt this God flow
Thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me
Because of you, I did it myself, so it means more to me
Did so many free shows and now they can't afford the fee
No one gave a fuck and now the whole world's recording me

Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a different crew every weekend
You, don't wanna dap back, keep sleeping

Lately, I been trying minimize all my stresses
Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessing
Diss me, I'ma diss you back on a hit song
PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on
Get it on your own or I can't respect it
See me in person, don't call, don't text it
Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it
Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it
Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be
No rap name to hide behind, this the real me
Before the plaques, I was certified
I do business, I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night
And another 35 before this verse
I be laying wide awake in my thoughts at night like
""God damn, motherfucker this worked""

Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do

Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now

Sip out my cup and it's dirty

I like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make some more money, it's got me delirious
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious
I got a main ting, that's a period
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up

I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling

She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to

About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87

Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch

Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Got a porter, the cash can't even stay in the house cause there's too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent I was too far behind
Fuck 'em two at a time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at
Niggas, no, I ain't lying, niggas, no, I ain't lying

We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought

I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her ""bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put the hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking the styrofoams up by the door
They don't let me back in, they ain't know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I'm working on having some manners
I'm thinking about it right now
I'm holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops

1219,Meek Mill;Tory Lanez,Lord Knows (feat. Tory Lanez),"All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
My bitch so bad she on my Christmas list
Remember I prayed I really wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I with some niggas that remember we took some risks for this
I'm talking risky business flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows that if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They said I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
They spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church at your wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called to collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up but I did not give up
'Cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game Philly as shit
Look at these rappers they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em because I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose came up from nothing
And now they like how he make millions so quick
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca
No way

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game till Fox be on
Seeing then momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Steady moving on these niggas get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Y'all looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?

I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

They still out to get me, they don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
They like Pablo, ""why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?""
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I...
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
'Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout' where the Grammy's go
I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up 'cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I snapchat that whole shit
Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See 3 POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"

1321,Miley Cyrus,Malibu,"I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I try to smile
Hoping I just stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The skies so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"

Akon
Convict, up front
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one
Could she be that lady

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Up front style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

(I feel it) Go on and crack now
(Oh, I see it) Don't let back now
(I'm-a call her) Then I put the mack down
(Money? No problem) Pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor

Eminem
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when I throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they goin' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Pretty Cat Dolls
Try'na hold my woody back through my drawers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're
I'm like, I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

Akon
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo

Soon I be all in them an' throwin' D

Hittin' no less than three
Block will style like wee, wee
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Worried 'bout if my butt's fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight

Is my idea of a update

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ring finger where the rock is
Deez hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz

Patrón on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I ain't dealing rubber bands

That's what I told her
Her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier
She ready for rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover

Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Whoa shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it sexy woman
Let me show it, made me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them rosé bottles foaming

She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop & lock
Had to break her off that gwap
Gal was fine, just like my glock

Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)

Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball till they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do

If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on

Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda

Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

(Cory Gunz)
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me

Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause

To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard?

1354,Sam Hunt,Break Up In A Small Town,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sitting there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town"

I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that

You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
'Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more henny and you're past the limit
You told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you

'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort

All this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

Found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

Can't tell me there's no point in trying

I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

I found peace in your violence

When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)

Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say ""Never say never...""
 
...So he calls me up, and he's like, ""I still love you,"" and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

Even let you and your girls go whip the Ghost 'round town
Draped you head to toe in Gucci Ghost, wow
And I never got a single fuckin' thank you from you
Or, ""I love you daddy""

The more the baddie, more the bratty

Take you shopping for them clothes
Before I got so distant
And you got so fucking cold

Just thankful that it's over
Just grateful that it's through

I got a table at the night sky
Got a bottle at this place
You and your girls drank all my liquor and you ain't even say thanks

I would wish you the best
But you already had it
You already had it, baby
I wish you the best but you already
Unh, you already had it, babe

Unh, lately I been feeling so dead in my own skin and it's a problem, I admit it
When I look into the mirror, that ain't me, that's someone different
Reminiscing, had a vision
Getting married, having kids

And let's be honest only thing I'm raising is these fucking digits so
And all these rumors that you bitches start are probably true, I did it
Feeding lines of blow to models off a mirror in the kitchen

It's ironic and specific
Can't say they never saw themselves
Starting a problems with addiction

I would wish you the best
But you already had it

This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood

Ain't got no shame 'bout it

I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""

We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you 'cause

We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music

Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
There don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her...

Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down oh
She said, ""let me lick this blunt""
Slow it down for a second
Break it down oh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break

Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoked a fatty sing Zoo-Wap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down oh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break

I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding your back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down oh
I got to lay back the roof
I got to break the new rules
She can't be taking no cost
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me my mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give a perc full of steam
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and geuss
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can...

Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down oh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve

Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressing me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie

So nobody made me but the main streets

Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Like when repent
Like when we women up
Gon' get it, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us are probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head)
Head, head, more head (head)
Oh God, bless the dead (yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you so scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land
I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie

Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than a nigga on a hang glider
4-5-6-7 chains on, just stay in your lane ho
Don't you like these A Wangs? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, on the loud singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em

No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!"

Getting books with my niggas

Girl I'm sorry you not the one for me

This the shit I don't condone
Cheating on your man but you can get it if you want it
Looking for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga taking shots, and I'm back check the postage, yeah
Hey now nigga, why won't you shut up?
This the motherfuckin' 502 come up
And every time I'm back in the city
Every bitch with a hidden agenda run up ('cause I'm on, nigga!)

Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had something special
But you don't mean nothing to me
Girl I'm sorry you not the one for me

Every nigga did you wrong, except for me
I'm next to blow and so you should've been next to me
Say you love sick, girl I got the remedy
I'll give you long dick and longevity
Don't settle for less or for infidelity
Niggas ain't built like me
He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fucking problems
Good brain, am I fucking with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'mma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'mma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating I'mma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'mma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no
(Boy if you don't get)

Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

Girl if you don't get the fuck from me

1451,Rick Ross;Meek Mill,So Sophisticated,"This shit is highly sophisticated I just make it look easy nigga
Follow me

I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mill so many times, I contemplated
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sippin' purple and that muthafucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh)
We so sophisticated (Ugh)
Shit so sophisticated (Woop)
Hundred millionaires, guess you made it (Ugh)

I'm so sophisticated
Smoking weed, busting open dolla liquor later
I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it's activator
Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated 'cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it
I got a bitch I'm fucking that you see on BET
My lil' Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we still get them for 10 a key
And if he faking, fuck him, tell them niggas ""C'est la vie""

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh)
We so sophisticated (Ugh)
Shit so sophisticated (Woop)
Hundred millionaires, guess you made it (Ugh)

Shittin' on these haters, ball hard D-Waders
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yea I'm in my bag
And these niggas so mad it's my turn now
And I get that cash, my bitch so bad, she know sophisticated
I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You ain't got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mob, then you gotta make an issue payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game's sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Ugh)
We so sophisticated (Ugh)
Shit so sophisticated (Woop)

Four stacks for the heels on my bitch feet
Car seats still smelling like 10 ki's
Tell a plug that I'm lookin' for increase
Wingstop, fat boy need a 10 piece
Say a nigga name and the car start
Nigga switching lane to lane like WalMart
Sippin Bordeaux out in Bordeaux
Hazard lights flashing on the four-door
Switch the Benzo for the Enzo
Back to the Benzo when the ends low
Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch something like a nympho
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Getting money ever since I came in it
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Motherfucker cause the devil is a lie

Big guns and big whips
Rich nigga talkin' big shit
Double cup, gold wrist
Double up on that blow, bitch!
Two mil on that I-95
Bow your head 'cause it's time to pay tithes

Am I down with the devil 'cause my roof come up missin'
Is that Lucifer juice in that two cup he sippin'
That's D'usse baby welcome to the dark side
Coulda got black list for the crack shit
White Jesus in my crock pot

Now I'm black Jesus turn water to wine
And all I had to do was turn the stove up
East Coast, winnin' at life, nigga, cheat code
The hatin' is flagrant, hit your free throws
The devil try to hit me with the RICO, them black people
Devil want these niggas hate they own kind
Gotta be illuminati if a nigga shine
Oh we can't be a nigga if a nigga rich?
Oh we gotta be the devil that's some nigga shit
You seen what I did to the stop and frisk
Brooklyn on the Barney's like we own the bitch
Give the money to the hood, now we all win
Got that Barney's floor lookin' like a VIM
Black hoodie, black skully
Bravado like Mavado, boy I'm that gully
Gettin' white money but I'm still black
All these niggas claiming king but I'm still that

In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?

Well I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy

'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game

She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way

I feel there's someone else
Worth your time, from the start
He's just one call away
From your mind, and your heart
It has begun, begun

Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA
In that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain

The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shady place
He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it
Mmm, come on

Moments don't pass me up, no no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui

I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving

Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, I shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love
Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love

The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels
Mmm, come on

Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design

I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love
Ooh, tap in to the frequency, love

Feel like I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived

Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne

Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you

To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
Shouldn't I, shouldn't I? What a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne

So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring

Shout out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Like when repent
Like when we women up
Gon' get it, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us are probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head)
Head, head, more head (head)
Oh God, bless the dead (yah)

I wear my chokes off to bed

I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

I wanna shoutout my enemies
All of them doubted me when they said no
You don't know what it did to me
The way I've been putting in work I knew it would happen eventually
The way that my section is glistening
They had to acknowledge the victory
All of these bottles was sent to me
You won't never ever hear me say we ran out
Even when I'm sitting at my table I stand out
Got my back against the wall hit me with the rotation
Ain't afraid to spend it all yeah if you with the lituation

I could build another Majic City with my check

Would she really want me if it wasn't for my check?
Look like the lotto with my check

I think I been moving way to fucking fast to slow down
Niggas always in a rush
All we wanna do is ball
Just might just call me Usher
Baby you don't have to call cause

I could fit your whole phone number in my check

New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain

Rockin John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin' ""everybody's famous""

I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the 80's
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a little sedated

No need, no need to take from me
Don't throw the paint on me

In this forest runnin' away
I slip up, I'm on the edge now

I nearly lose my grip, but you held on to me
And you shake me, and tell me that I'm okay, but

I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me
I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me, for me

I wake up and the sky's blood red
I'm still heavy breathin'
Felt so much more than dreamin'
I get up, they're at the edge of my bed
Yeah, how did they find me, find me?
They said there's somethin' bleedin' in me
Somethin' screamin' in me
Somethin' buried deep beneath
Well I need to, need to get away
So I get it, steal this get-away
And I accelerate, and I accelerate
But my gears got stuck
I'm on this road now
I'm so alone now, swervin' out of control now
And I crash the whip
And this tree flew through me
Arms out, you pull me
And wipe my wounds clean

I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me
I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me, for me

Ay, oh, I am, ay, oh, I am

In a world without an end or beginning
Babygirl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears them calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It made her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears them calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

I don't think you understand...

In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

I'm doin' good, I left the Rex, I'm off the strip now
Had to upgrade all my shooters, got 'em 30 clips
Told 'em best not wear my merch when you be doin' shit
My bro still in the trap, I'm tryna get him out the shit
'Cause he can't build a house with only half a brick
Ain't talkin' burgers when I say that we was hittin' licks
You fuck around I might just fuck around and fuck your bitch
You switch your life around and that's when all your family switch
Tell me who else would keep the lights on if I wasn't lit
These pussies actin' like some toilets, wanna take my shit
I got some Mali's from the south side, they be sprayin' shit
Like 2K player mode, I had to recreate myself
You wearin' fake designer, try to recreate my belt

I'm just a brown boy with a bag
I got hitters poppin' shit, I'm just poppin' all these tags
Come get your issue, we got mags
The only time when I'm not fuckin' on your bitch, she on the rag

Told my plug I need a pound
You know I'm good for it
I book a flight for your bitch
She know I'm good for it
My jeweler made another chain
He know I'm good for it
I'm what the music game needed
Yeah I'm good for it"

Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag a blow

Every time we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know man (pow! pow!), you know man

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'mma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Wrap a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you cause

Every time we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
""Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""

Kendrick Lamar:
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Wake your punk ass up
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah
Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah
How we do?

Kendrick Lamar:
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my mama's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice

MC Eiht:
G-yeah
Cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixing shit since the eighties, loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand

Kendrick Lamar:
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn
You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for?

Weirdos in the background
Black out when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, ""Pick a fur""
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
Cause these niggas actin' too fishy

Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah
 
Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, ""You bad and you know it""
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow"
1607,DJ Khaled;Big Sean;Kendrick Lamar;Betty Wright,Holy Key,"This is, this is...
Doing what I gotta do
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go
DJ Khaled

Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key (the holy key, the holy key, the holy key...)

And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

Holy, Holy key, holy"

Dirty politics never gone greed

George bush doesn't care about black people

Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 2020 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin' with that hat with the colors that's white and red
I know some people wish I'd act white instead
Say I'd use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that everything I do I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don't get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon need patience
And not violence giving hospitals more patients, now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop!
I'm just as angry another person got shot!
Don't be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I'ma tell you what I need right now

I need my people of color...
Don't run from Trump, run against him!

Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn't take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
Wish I could erase that, face facts

Take it back, take it way back, take it way way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36am. Where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn't there, addicted to crack cocaine, Alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
Way, way back
So I'm gonna tell you about that, I'm gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was Happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist
Which is crazy
Because how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men But you racist
Like bitch, that don't make no sense
But it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin him a nigga
The kids at school callin him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can't be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
He saw violence, murderers, drug dealers
He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn't be shit!
You ain't gon be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere
And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity
And see, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody, was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
Because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters
That were uneducated and that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant, that cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight, and kill, and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message
Of equality, for every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and
All this, because he didn't know, he didn't know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep
But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said No!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No no!
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah
Now I also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life
""You just a white boy."" ""You ain't never experienced that shit.""
""You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there.""
""Oh no, no, we no, we weren't there, we didn't live with you, in your Section 8 household. We didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household. We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside."" ""And since you white, you gotta have money, right?""
And this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would
Never be
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah, yeah
And he's here to say:
Even though we're all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There's extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they're not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they're going to hell
You can believe it's not right
You can believe you're superior, fine
Just stop killing each other"

Bought a chain, bought two more, yeah, I deserve that for myself
And my neighbors look at me like, ""How he purchase that himself?""

Couldn't see I was the best for you
Now you gotta figure out what's next for you
Now you feel regret, oh do you?
Baby, I could care less for you
Trust, I'm not even sweating you
You ran me dry, better yet it's still you
Out of respect for you

Haha, I had to put a time stamp on this, yeah
It's my birthday
And I'm feeling great
I feel great
Yeah, fuck it, I'm feeling great
24 today, by the way
Okay

Came a long way (yeah, I came a long way)
Ay, I looked up and said goddamn I came a long way
In the VIP, this shit feel like a showcase
Take me to a place I'd rather be, there's no place
I gotta pocket full of cash, it's more than I made last year when I was packing
Oh wait, it been two years, I lost track and
No way I'm going back, I been in mansions
I been in whips so quick that you lose traction
And made 6 figure transactions
Met a lot of pretty women, A.K.A distractions
And some fuck niggas with subliminal captions
I won't, I won't, show these lames no compassion
Wanna play the game, gotta have expansion
Ex sent me an email, came with attachments
And like a fan of the show, nigga I started snapping

What's happening? What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening, oh, what's happening?
Whoa, whoa, high stakes got me feeling like I'm gambling (I can ball but lose it all)
Drink got a nigga rambling (like I'm talking to myself)
But hit me up

I wake up and see a roof over my head
Used to be the roof of a '04 Audi
That shit used to be my bed
Lot of disrespect from those who used to be my friends
Lot of chicks to replace, hoes used to be friends
I don't fuck with you, what don't you comprehend?
Give a fuck who I offend, real and fake cannot blend
And I pray to God I never lose a cake, Amen (Amen)
With the high stakes, I'm in
I'm in, even when niggas after me
I still stroll through the city casually
RIP Staten G, Ali gone, that's another tragedy
Oh my God, who gon' show the kids strategy?
I done seen so many things that they gotta see
I made it to the game using honesty
I know my mama proud of me
God tell her she gave birth to a young prodigy

Ay, ay, thank you
To the most up
High up, high up
Praying that them blessings don't stop
I'm praying that them blessings don't
Yeah"
1642,Bryson Tiller,Before You Judge,"Check yourself
Check, check, check
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Ch-ch-check yourself before you wreck yourself
Yeah
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Before you wreck yourself, check, check, check

Hey, I'm back, so what's the deal now?
I still don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel now
I got you hot, lil' nigga, chill out
Say you coming for the spot? Bitches will spill now
Either staying in the game, bro
Fuck the niggas waiting on Young Tiller to change up
Niggas waiting on me to run out of paper
I don't ever speak on niggas, nah, I barely say much
Fuck, I look like, bringing niggas names up?
I can't let a fuck nigga get famous
These niggas, they wanna de-fame us
They wanna betray us, they wanna play games, oh no, no
This loyal, this how they won't portray us
Looked at my dog like, ""Fuck it, let's make 'em hate us""
If you got paid for the attention that you paid us
You would be a rich nigga but you just a bitch nigga
Foreign whip, make you throw a fit, nigga
Foreign bitch, I know you won't get with her
Lame niggas not the type that she consider
You thinking of speaking with her, boy, you better reconsider
Hey, I'm my daughter's keeper
And I don't take with the threats, or promises either, nigga
You gon' have to see me some day or another
And for my blood, bruh, I'm a cold motherfucker
(So!)

Before you judge me
Check yourself before you judge me
Hey, shit could get ugly
Next time you might not be so lucky
What you want from me?
What these niggas want from me?
This is a, ""Don't fuck with me""
Hey, think twice before you fuck with me

What it is though?
2016 Tiller on this shit, so
Most likely I'ma vent up on this shit, so
Well, um, damn, here it go
You see the shit is so new to me, bro
Not the music, that's easy, it come smooth to me, bro
When I should've been in school, I was making tunes truancy, bro
Low-key, them cool kids weren't as cool as me, bro
I fell in love and had a mini me, thank you Jesus
Ten fingers, ten toes on her pretty feet, seriously, thank you Jesus
Pray for it every day in the UPS trailers
And you gave her to me like I asked, that's amazing, Jesus
I know the saying, give them an inch and they take a mile
But Jesus I really need this, I gotta make it out
Studio shit on eBay, I gotta purchase
I told my niggas, ""Lend me 600 dollars, it'll be worth it, let's cop it"" (check, check, check, check)
So many times I second guessed myself, nigga, I never wanted to be an artist, nah (check, check, check, check)
I don't wanna be the centre of attention but I guess I do this shit for the Harley, nah (check, check, check, check)
If you know me, you know I just want to be able to walk into Target and people not be astonished
Man, let me do my shopping
But this in my job, I asked for it, I got it, let's go
Just got a new manager, my last one was fucking up my vision
Can't believe this nigga still tryna get a percentage
I gave you back your investment, get out your feelings
Telling people that the money changed me, nigga, the money saved me
Nigga, money is the reason that you fuck with me, ain't it?
And even though this shit got me angry, I'ma let God fix it
'Cause I know if I fix it, my daughter gon' have to grow up without a father figure
I'ma end up in prison, wishing I never got into this business
It's nothing personal, I made a business decision
I might have a job for you if you shape or you could fill the position
That's as real as it gets
And sometimes I don't know how to deal with this shit
I've been searching for the answers in my idol's music
In his earlier days, man, I know he went through this
He got through this, I'll get through it

Before you judge me
Check yourself before you judge me
Hey, shit could get ugly
Next time you might not be so lucky
What you want from me?
What these niggas want from me?
This is a, ""Don't fuck with me""
Hey, think twice before you fuck with me

Check yourself
Check, check, check
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Check yourself before you wreck yourself
Yeah
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Before you wreck yourself, check, check, check"

When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet

And upload it, it'll get maximum views

Thought I was ready, I wasn't ready

Time to go make some friends
Find me somebody to keep me safe

Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag

White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this I can't be around you

Careful, Momma, watch what you say
You talking to me like your new bae
Girl, talking to me like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby

You made me drown in it, touche, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
You know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?

If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher

I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper

Motherfuckers wanna get famous
Bust guns and get dangerous (dangerous)
Daddy graduated from Cambridge
Money talks in every language
Real recognize that stainless
Silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is
Y'all don't know what that uh
Y'all about that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come, baby girl gon' be about that maternity life
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone that maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
'Cause we do what we do
But hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them
Revolve them
Take care of all of them like this
I might just go crazy
All the way
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away
But not us
Momma and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle
Let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not not not not be the same
Might not be the...

Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gang, gang, gang
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver

Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day, I woke up, and said I'm bout to do for the rest of my life
No question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies
I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around until the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate and when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen
Stop spending money on things that glisten

I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
I Know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
And I want it [?]

(Cardo got ranks)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib
It was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Play some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you were out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catchin' the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like...
Why a nigga can't live? Get this money, fuck these bitches
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pounds
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hope I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Yo 40 I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with me
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, this the real one baby)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we 'gon set this party off right)
Oh when it all

Kanye West:
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all

Kanye West:
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all

Kanye West:
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon
(And when it falls down)

Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we gon' set this party off right)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life)
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

1767,Majid Jordan,Not Ashamed,"You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say
You want my love, but you want it your own way
You're left or right, depending on the day
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change
Lately, lately, I don't like what I've been going through
But I gotta keep my chest from falling for you
I can't, I can't, I can't enter the danger zone
But I open up to someone so cold

(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You don't know what to say
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
Want it your own way
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Your feelings always change
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
You're not ashamed

Are you with me, or are you against me
'Cause when I see you, you move too quickly
Fifth time in the week and you're leaving
Then we don't even speak on the weekend
Next week, it's baby forgive me
This time it's different, believe me
Different day, but the same old story
Not ashamed of the way you ignore me

Prove yourself to me
Prove yourself to me
'Cause I'm not the type to give it up for no reason
Show yourself to me
Tell me who you wanna be
But you always got to leave (show me)
(But I open up to someone)

You're not ashamed
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You're not ashamed
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
But you want it your own way
You're not ashamed
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Depending on the day
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
Your feelings change

You love me, you hate me
You want me, but then you resent me
I'm ashamed of the way that you treat me
Scheming for you is too easy
What's your number, I'm about to delete it
Same mistake, I'm about to repeat it
We're both too drunk to be speaking
I'm not playing this game (game, game)

'Cause I'm not the type, to give it up, give it up, no
Prove yourself to me
Tell me honestly
You could show yourself to me, but
(I open up to someone)

You're not ashamed
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You're not ashamed
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
Said you want it your own way
You're not ashamed
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Depending on the day
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
Your feelings change

You're lying to my face (you're lying to my face)
Driving me insane (driving me insane)
Playing all these games (playing all these games)
You're lying to my face
That's some news I can't erase

You're not ashamed
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
Ooh, you're not ashamed
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
Ooh, you want my love, but you want it your own way
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Love to ride depending on the day
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
Your feelings change

You wanna play with me and act like we're ok
You want my love, but you want it your own way
You love to ride, depending on the day
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change"
