0,0,Charlie Cunningham,Minimum,"How do I walk this earth
So much work at first it goes
How should I walk this earth
So much worse the further, the further you go

Go take off a load
Letting your wings unfold and keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought but you're managing
That's how you evened out, out

Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between the wrong and the right
You get yours I'm gonna get mine
Is that what you signed for
They're feeding you lines to keep you on their side
It works every time

What you got to live for now you got the whole of the world at your feet?
And how much more can you pass yourself round?
What you got to live for now you got the whole of the world at your feet?
But you're still shaking
You need to make up some ground

Go take off a load
Letting your wings unfold and keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought but you're managing
That's how you evened out, out"
3,3,The Paper Kites,Bloom - Bonus Track,"In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness
And you fill my head with you

Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out

Can I be close to you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh

Can I take it to a morning
Where the fields are painted gold
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?

When the evening pulls the sun down
And the day is almost through
Oh, the whole world it is sleeping
But my world is you

Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)

Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (ah), ooh (ah)

Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh"
4,4,Tall Heights,Spirit Cold,"How do I wake my spirit cold?
We always say when our history's told
If only we knew the things we know
There's a question ages old

Let me down easy, let me down slow
If all good things ever come and go
Let me back down in a place I know
Hold the nail for the hammer stroke

Oh this my trash, this my tome
Oh this my blood, this my bone

How do I learn my dreams to mold,
To lay them bare in the morning cold?
If they're still out there then the chasm grows
For all you know, for all you've known

Let me down easy, let me down slow
If all good things ever come and go
Let me back down in a place I know
Hold that nail for the hammer stroke

Oh this my weapon, this my loam
Oh this my blood, this my bone

How do I wake my spirit cold?
Most people die but others just go
She's still out there and the chasm grows
Steady are the feet in the morning glow

Oh this my trash, this my tome
Oh this my weapon, this my loam
Oh this my mountain, this is my home

How do I wake my spirit cold?
There's a question ages old"
7,7,The Lumineers,Angela (Single Version),"When you left this town with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
Till the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

And from the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela, it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela, it's a long time coming
Oh Angela, spent your whole life running away

Home at last
Home at last

Vacancy, hotel room
Lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knees
I belong, I believe

Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last

Home at last
Mmm"
8,8,Vance Joy,Lay It On Me,"I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go
Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now"
10,10,Lord Huron,The Night We Met,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"
16,16,Leon Bridges,River,"Been travelling these wide roads for so long
My heart's been far from you
10, 000 Miles gone

Oh, I wanna come near and give you
Every part of me
But there is blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

In my darkness I remember
Momma's word reoccur to me:
""Surrender to the good lord
And he'll wipe your slate clean""

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Take me to your river
I wanna know

Dip me in your smooth water
I go in
As a man with many crimes
Come up for air
As my sins flow down the jordan

I wanna go wanna go wanna go
I wanna know wanna know wanna know
Wanna go wanna go wanna go
Wanna know wanna know wanna know
Wanna go wanna go wanna go
Wanna know wanna know wanna know

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Lord please let me know
Take me to your river
I wanna know"
17,17,Bon Iver,Holocene,"""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles

3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
The automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me âLit Paradeâ
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night, it clutched the light
The hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles"
19,19,The Staves,Steady,"Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Oh God, oh God, oh God
God, I'm only human and I'm helpless
Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Rabbit in a snare, why you sleeping softly in your bed?
When unruly wild blood is pumping, why you running scared?
Why you running scared?
Rabbit in a snare, why you sleeping softly in your bed?
Why you running scared?
Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Oh God, oh God, oh God
God I'm only human and I'm helpless
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you see from where you're standing?)
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you hear where I'm coming from?)
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you see from where you're standing?)
And the line will read that I was never here
(Can you hear where I'm coming from?)
Steady, steady, steady
You steady touch our love so much, I'm sleepless
Oh God, oh God, oh God
God I'm only human and I'm helpless"
20,20,Tall Heights,Horse to Water,"The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken
I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold
In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot
I willed the car to start to bring me home to you

Lead me back from the darkness like you do

Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview
To wish back an image of myself I thought was true
So now when colors fade and on that day of days
I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue

Oh and lead me back from the darkness like you do

Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes
Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit
I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken
Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big

But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met
You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago
There was something about you I struggled to forget
My blood was rushing down to you

You were leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do
Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse
'Cause you're a wanderer too"
22,22,Fleet Foxes,"If You Need To, Keep Time On Me","How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?
Â 
If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me
Â 
Who knows what State is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?
Â 
If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me
Â 
When I need to, I'll keep time on you

Wide oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes heatless fire
Â 
But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me
Â 
How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me"
24,24,Villagers,Nothing Arrived - Live from Spotify London,"Savanna scatters and the seabird sings
So why should we fear what travel brings?
What were we hoping to get out of this?
Some kind of momentary bliss?

I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived

It's our dearest ally, it's our closest friend
It's our darkest blackout, it's our final end
My dear sweet nothing, let's start anew
From here on in, it's just me and you

I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived

Well I guess it's over, I guess it's begun
It's a losers' table, but we've already won
It's a funny battle, it's a constant game
I guess I was busy, when nothing came

I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy

I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived
I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived"
27,27,JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez,Stay Alive,"There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow 
In a world gone lean

Sometimes there's things a man cannot know
Gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
Engine won't turn
And the train won't leave

Engines won't turn and the train won't leave

I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
In the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Well the way I feel is the way I write
It isn't like the thoughts of the man who lies
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming 
Open your eyes
Look into the sun as the new days rise

And I will wait for you tonight
You're here forever and you're by my side
I've been waiting all my life
To feel your heart as it's keeping time
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Dawn is coming 
Open your eyes
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes

Look into the sun as the new days rise
There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean

But there is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming open your eyes
Look into the sun as a new days rise"
28,28,Of Monsters and Men,Slow And Steady,"The lights go out, I am all alone
All the trees outside are buried in the snow
I spend my night dancing with my own shadow
And it holds me and it never lets me go

I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know

My dear, old friend, take me for a spin
Two wolves in the dark, running in the wind
I'm letting go, but I've never felt better
Passing by all the monsters in my head

And I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know
And I'm never ready
'Cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me
Show what I want to show

And I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know
And I'm never ready
'Cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me
Show what I want to show"
29,29,Vance Joy,Georgia,"She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

Lips generous and all
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I I never understood what was at stake
Never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want a trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

And I I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out"
30,30,Bibio,Petals,"To see age in a flower
The dawns are speeding up
You know it'll hurt you
Feel all of a sudden
Tired and teary-eyed
You knew it'd kill you
Don't wear a tie that'll choke you
To death in the city
Take it off and forget
Spare the fret that'll make you
Miss all of summer
Sweat it out and forgive
To see loss in a shower
The petals turn to mush
It still disappoints you
Then less of a sudden
You wire your weary mind
To let it deceive you
Don't force a smile that'll make you
Resent the city
Play it soft and forgive
Keep the frown that'll make you
Squint in the summer
Play it slow and forget"
32,32,The Barr Brothers,Even The Darkness Has Arms,"I was holding my breath
When the tightrope walker
Slipped into the moonglow
Saying all my children follow me
Maybe it's time to go
You can be chrome when you're wise
Can be wise when you're blue
And baby if I have, then I have for you

Bribing the jury to keep me in jail
Singing ""Tea for the Tillerman""
And although I lie fantastically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
You can be wrong when you're right
Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight, then I die for you

Calling on those that call me son
Great-grandson, or grandson
Great uncles, aunts and relatives
To judge what I have done
Gonna make right by you
Even if it's all I do
And if it's all I do, then I do for you

People will raise a whole lot of hell about
The water and the wind-mill
And although I stab chaotically
It hurts no one but me
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
Baby, I have it, and I have you too

And a light in the window
To pass the night through
May be so uncertain but what can I do
Keeping it on, keeping it on
And I know I like it but what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know
How to love you

I was breakin the law when the knight (?)
When the straw hit the whipperwill
(Missing line) oh I oh I oh I do
Hungry enough to kill
Wherever the white dove goes
It goes unseen
And he sees below
And he knows you're dreamin'

I bring to you with reverant hands
All the books that my love abides
Kind woman that my passion wore
Like the shoreline wears the tides
Maybe the water went dry
Keeping an eye on you
And with an eye on you, it could drown me too

People will raise a whole lot of hell about
The water and the wind-mill
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
Baby, I have it, and I have you too

And a light in the window
To pass the night through
May be so uncertain but what can I do
Keeping it on, keeping it on
And I know I like it but what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know
How to love you"
33,33,Mumford & Sons;Baaba Maal,There Will Be Time,"But in the cold light I live to love and adore you

So I opened up my eyes
To a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night

Why do I keep falling?

35,35,Langhorne Slim;The Law,Changes,"Things could be stranger but I don't know how
I'm going through changes now
I've spent a lifetime trying to figure it out
I'm going through changes now

And I've just begun under a purple sun
There's many reasons we are what we've become
I'm going through changes, ripping out pages
I'm going through changes now

I knew it once, but I forgot
I'm going through changes now
We want everything but what we've got
I'm going through changes now

Maybe it's too soon under a purple moon
But I'd ride off with you in a big balloon
I'm going through changes, rattling cages
I'm going through changes now

Things could be different but I don't know how
I'm going through changes, through all of the strangeness
I'm going through changes now"

And incredible pain

If you were here, I'd find you
If you could see the ground that I am, here
From the legends, a lesson, you're on
Already know your way, I am hours away

I know you want it
You're singing about it
I know you want it

You stood tall the fire began to let out,
I trusted you'd refrain and keep closed your mouth

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

Words crashing through the flames smoke spreading far
And I thought we'd remain free from it's harm

You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me
You let the fire out, and it's right in front of me

Will we burn
Will we burn
From the fire will we learn,
To be mindful and keep away from the words that ignite the flame
Our words will ignite the flame

I'm sinking, all my love could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I needed
I hope that I'm not too late, I hope I'm not too late

Back of the room, how come my friends already know you?
Feel like a kid, too shy to speak up so I keep it hid
Oh butterflies, you steal my sleep each night

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart

I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekends

And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else

Ooh...

So let me go

44,44,Iron & Wine,Call It Dreaming,"Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
Any rain softly kisses us on the face
Anywhere means we're running
We can sleep and see 'em coming
Where we drift and call it dreaming
We can weep and call it singing

Where we pray when our hearts are strong enough
We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood
Where we see enough to follow
We can hear when we are hollow
Where we keep the light we're given
We can lose and call it living

Where the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every night knows how long it's supposed to last
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine

Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray
Where our water isn't hidden
We can burn and be forgiven
Where our hands hurt from healing
We can laugh without a reason

'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every moon in our bodies make shining glass
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say
Before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine"

And we'll lose our winter coats in the spring

Scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh, I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

Oh

'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet, no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me

Oh, but I don't wanna know
But who will take you home
Who will take you home
Who will take you home
If I let you go

Oh

And now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love if you don't
No you don't
So I won't say I love you if you don't"
49,49,George Ezra,Barcelona,"Barcelona,
I still long to hold her once more, oh,
My boots of leather,
From Europe
I gather you know, know

Every time you have to go
Shone my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

A native man sang in a foreign tongue,
I still ache to know the song that he sung,
Barcelona

Every time you have to go
Shone my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

Every time you have to go
Shone my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

Barcelona
Barcelona

Every time you have to go
I shone my mind and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona"
50,50,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"
51,51,A Blaze of Feather,Carousel,"Sorry is a word I fail to say
Struggle with the hurt, the weight, the pace
Trouble in the darkness shifting shade
I miss her every time I try and change

I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
I can never come in the light of day
Under night memory tears me

Raising my head like a hurricane
Carousel shadows calling
Dancing

I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
(Ben Howard)
With my last breath
I comfort you

I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through"
56,56,Max Jury,Numb,"Honey, here I go again
Down that crooked road of sin
My momma locked me out again
And hung me high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

When I sing my stranger blues
I make it on the local news
Everybody likes to see you lose
And hang you high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

Little bluebird at my window
Sing a pretty song for me
Don't you know that you can fly, fly, fly away
Don't you know that you can leave

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb"
57,57,Benjamin Francis Leftwich,Tilikum,"I wonder what you're thinking
Staring through the rain
Going through our baby names
Your husband thinks you're sleeping
At a motorway hotel
He doesn't know tonight you're flying out of hell

Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bond lover, tonight

You're turning on your phone now
Your hands begin to shake
I'm just across the harbour bridge you say
I flew out here to tell you
I couldn't hold your pain then
Day by day I waited for your heart to melt

Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bond lover, tonight

Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bond lover, tonight"
58,58,Avec,Sailing Away,"I'm still sittin' here
With the only sound of the dawn
And I still wonder where
I'll be the day after all

And can you feel
The grass beneath your toes
It's like a story
Which began long time ago

And it's slowly getting cold
And I turn apart like you
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

The lights fade
Is walking next to me
My feet are stuck
In the earth underneath

And it's slowly getting cold
And I'm torn apart like you are
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away
I'm sailin', I'm sailin' away

The ways they're crossing as long as you go
The lights go out, the lights go on
The ways they're crossing as long as you go"
60,60,James Bay,Hold Back The River,"Tried to keep you close to me,
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But think that I should have been

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we call against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho

Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river, so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold

Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water, won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other"
62,62,James Vincent McMorrow,Higher Love,"Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, standing out there alone
Oh, a yearning and it's real for me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love I've been thinking of?

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love"
63,63,Damien Rice,Older Chests,"Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small, and grow in time
And we all seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf
Too many books
Read me your favorite line

Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
He came back the other day
You know, some things in life may change
And some things they stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time

Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names

Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times
She broke down the other day
You know, some things in life may change
But some things they stay the same

Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Time, there's always time
On my mind
Pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time"
67,67,Lucy Rose,Shiver,"We broke
Everything that was right
We both enjoyed a good fight

And we solved
All the holes we had to breathe
To make the other one leave

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And we stole
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
We'd never turn out to be real

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

Like I used to"

That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back

Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo

77,77,Koda,Staying,"As winter takes me now, of cold and clammy skin
A barren empty womb, as I am born again
It's pulling at my hair, and crawling all within
A gentle beating heart is swept away by sin

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

That's enough the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love
As dark comes the night
We all die young

The monster in your head, won't surface again
Be still my child, wash away the sin
And I as future king, walk off the edge
Hold me by my name, hold me till the end

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love

That's enough, the end
Comes undone
Falls off the edge, falls out young
Falls off the edge, falls off love"
78,78,Us The Duo,Better Together,"There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, ""Why are we here?"" and ""Where do we go?""
And ""How come it's so hard?""
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of the dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me

But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"
89,89,The Civil Wars,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene (Ooh)
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, be careful what you do (Ooh)
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (No!)
And mother always told me, be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, the lie becomes the truth (Hey)

Billie Jean is not my lover,
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
The kid is not my son,
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans (Ooh)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round,
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice (Oh, think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby cried, his eyes looked like mine, (Oh no)
'Cause we dance on the floor in the round.

People always told me, be careful what you do, (Ooh)
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (No)
She came and stood right by me, because the smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon, she called me to her room
Hey-ey!

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one,
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one,
But the kid is not my son

So, Billie Jean is not my lover, (She just a girl)
Billie Jean' is not my lover, (She just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover..."

I'm so reliant
I'm so dependant
I'm such a fool

I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear
Can't face the truth

See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her

Would you fight for us
Or will you walk away?
All I can say is don't be afraid
It's not where you laid your head before
It's where it lay

Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight"
112,112,Ellie Goulding,Your Song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"

When it's cold outside I've got the month of May.
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I've got so much honey the bees envy me.
I've got a sweeter song than the birds from the trees.
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

You don't want to see
You can't seem to avoid
When you're trying to be right
On this trespassed life where
You don't seem yo care
And you're making the motions to be aware
As to why you're here

All that the countless moments
Ask of the countless thoughts
Trying to figure me out
That never seemed to come around
Till I got to that part of you
That's me

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah

I mean more now
I want more now
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven now

You're so golden
I'm so golden now

I want more now
I want more now

Looked out at the moon tonight
I can't get enough
You're hand as it starts to touch
I can't get enough

Lie down, lie down

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
You are so beautiful
Nah nah nah nah nah
You are so beautiful
Nah nah nah nah nah..."

Summertime sadness 
I just wanted you to know

Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99 
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side 
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

These scattered ashes that are hid away
I lay them all at Your feet

From the corners of my deepest shame
The empty places where I've worn Your name
Show me the love I say I believe

O Help me to lay it down
Oh, Lord I'll lay it down

O let this be where I die
My Lord with thee crucified
Be lifted high as my kingdom fall
Once and for all, once and for all

There is victory in my saviors loss
And In the crimson flowing from the cross
Pour over me, pour over me

O let this be where I die
My Lord with thee crucified
Be lifted high as my kingdom fall
Once and for all, once and for all

O Lord I lay it down
O Lord I lay it down
Help me to lay it down
O Lord I lay it down

O let this be where I die
My Lord with thee crucified
Be lifted high as my kingdom fall

Once and for all

Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin

Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today thereâs no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling, oh

The precious blood of Jesus Christ

O come to the altar

Bow down before Him

Those dazzling heights too vast to climb
I got so high to fall so far
But I found heaven as love swept low

My heart beating
My soul breathing
I found my life
When I laid it down
Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky
When my knees hit the ground

What treasure waits within Your scars
The gift of freedom gold can't buy
I bought the world and sold my heart
You traded heaven to have me again

I found my life
When I laid it down
Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky
When my knees hit the ground

For You are raised to life again

311,311,Big Daddy Weave,Redeemed,"Seems like all I could see was the struggle
Haunted by ghosts that lived in my past
Bound up in shackles of all my failures
Wondering how long is this gonna last
Then You look at this prisoner and say to me
""Son, stop fighting a fight that's already been won""

I am redeemed
You set me free
So I'll shake off theses heavy chains
And wipe away every stain
Now I'm not who I used to be
I am redeemed
I am redeemed

All my life I have been called unworthy
Named by the voice of my shame and regret
But when I hear You whisper, ""Child lift up your head""
I remember oh God, You're not done with me yet

I don't have to be
The old man inside of me
'Cause his day is long dead and gone
Because I've got a new name
A new life I'm not the same
And a hope that will carry me home"

I cannot create it
I cannot sustain it
It's Your love that's keeping (captured) me

Please be my strength...

At my final breath
I hope that I can say
I've fought the good fight of faith

I am on the fence about nearly everything I've seen
And I have felt the fire be put out by too much gasoline
And we're all strangers passing through a place and time afternoon
Life is but a vision in a window that we're peeking through

A helpless conversation with a man who says he cares a lot
It's a hopeless confrontation about who might throw a punch or not
We are all transgressors, we're all sinners, we're all astronauts
So if you're beating death then raise your hand but shut up if you're not

'Cause I am the difference maker

327,327,Burlap To Cashmere,Love Reclaims the Atmosphere,"I'm staring at the mirror 
As the shadows plague my room
In every risen hero there's a choir that resumes

I used to be a soldier but a painter I became
I used to walk on water but now I fan the flame

Oh the dizziness of traffic as her garden starts to wither
She opens up her violin so the darkness can forgive her
And today we'll crucify the fear 
As love reclaims the atmosphere

There is guidance in transition when the body starts to rust
The earth begins to rumble and the particles of dust relay
That message of decay

Oh the dizziness of traffic as her garden starts to wither
She opens up her violin so the darkness can forgive her
And today we'll crucify the fear 
As love reclaims the atmosphere

Be honest in transition when preparing for the feast
Send blessings to your critics and careful with the least of these
Release the prisoners free"
328,328,Laura Story,Blessings,"We pray for blessings
We pray for peace
Comfort for family, protection while we sleep
We pray for healing, for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering
All the while, You hear each spoken need
Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things

'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops
What if Your healing comes through tears
What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You're near
What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise

We pray for wisdom
Your voice to hear
We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt your goodness, we doubt your love
As if every promise from Your Word is not enough

All the while, You hear each desperate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe

When friends betray us
When darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heart
That this is not our home

What if my greatest disappointments
Or the aching of this life
Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy
What if trials of this life
The rain, the storms, the hardest nights
Are your mercies in disguise"
330,330,JJ Heller,Love Me,"He cries in the corner where nobody sees 
He's the kid with the story no one would believe
He prays every night, ""Dear God won't you please 
Could you send someone here who will love me?""

Who will love me for me
Not for what I have done or what I will become
Who will love me for me
'Cause nobody has shown me what love
What love really means

Her office is shrinking a little each day
She's the woman whose husband has run away
She'll go to the gym after working today
Maybe if she was thinner 
Then he would've stayed
And she says

Who will love me for me? 
Not for what I have done or what I will become
Who will love me for me?
'Cause nobody has shown me what love, what love really means

He's waiting to die as he sits all alone
He's a man in a cell who regrets what he's done
He utters a cry from the depths of his soul
""Oh Lord, forgive me, I want to go home""

Then he heard a voice somewhere deep inside
And it said 
""I know you've murdered and I know you've lied
I have watched you suffer all of your life 
And now that you'll listen, I'll tell you that I""

I will love you for you

Grace, she comes with a heavy load
Memories, they can't be erased
Like a pill I swallow that makes me well
But leaves an awful taste

Oh I know this song won't do
Enough to prove my love to you
In my heart you'll always know
There is a place only love can go
There is a place only you can go

Take my notions and words to heart
This is the cry of a man
I can't bring you fortune or noble life
But I'll love you all I can

Oh I know this song won't do
Enough to prove my love to you
But in my heart you'll always know
There is a place only you can go

Oh I know this song won't do
Enough to prove my love to you
In my heart you'll always know
There is a place only love can go
There is a place only you can go"
335,335,Andrew Peterson,Dancing In The Minefields,"Well, I was nineteen, you were twenty-one
The year we got engaged
And everyone said we were much too young
But we did it anyway

We got the rings for forty each
From a pawn shop down the road
We said our vows and took the leap
Now fifteen years ago

And we went dancing in the minefields
We went sailing in the storms
And it was harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for

""I do"" are the two most famous last words
The beginning of the end
But to lose your life for another, I've heard
Is a good place to begin

'Cause the only way to find your life
Is to lay your own life down
And I believe it's an easy price
For the life that we have found

And we're dancing in the minefields
We're sailing in the storms
This is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
That's what the promise is for

So when I lose my way, find me
When I lose love's chains, bind me
At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days
When I forget my name, remind me

'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man
So there's nothing left to fear
So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands
Till the shadows disappear

'Cause he promised not to leave us
And his promises are true
So in the face of all this chaos
Baby, I can dance with you

So let's go dancing in the minefields
Let's go sailing in the storms
Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields
And kicking down the doors

Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields
And sailing in the storms
Oh, this is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
That's what the promise is for"
336,336,Jenny & Tyler,Muse,"Sometimes love surprises me like raindrops
Taps me on the shoulder, over and again
And I can't go on, got to wait until the rain stops
Got to say what's on my heart and hope I can

O come to me my muse and set me free
Break the chains that bind the words my soul longs to speak
O come to me my muse, so softly sweetly
My heart longs to speak

Sometimes love wakes me up like sunlight
And I will not close the curtains, though the light it hurts my eyes
I will get on up, stare straight into the sun, and hope the words come soon
My heart is racing but my tongue won't move

O come to me my muse and set me free
Break the chains that bind the words my soul longs to speak
O come to me my muse, so softly sweetly
My heart longs to speak

Not just words with little meaning
Not a love that will be fleeting
But with a heart that is repeating words with fruit, words of truth

O come to me my muse and set me free
Break the chains that bind the words my soul longs to speak
O come to me my muse, so softly sweetly
My heart longs to speak"
337,337,Sara Groves,Fireflies and Songs,"Thirty years ago I was a little girl
Riding in the back seat of the car.
A woman sang 'You don't bring me flowers anymore.'
I felt the sadness in my little heart.

We're looking for the music
In the music box,
Tearing it to pieces,
Trying to find a song.

I was drawn to you in ways I can't explain.
I fought like crazy but I couldn't stay away.
Piled on expectations and lots of blame,
Like we couldn't do it any other way.

We're looking for a firefly
Moving through the night,
Staring at that one place
Swear it never lights.

We're looking for the music
In the music box,
Tearing it to pieces,
Trying to find a song.

Were you surprised our hearts were not like ticking clocks?
The faces and hands easy to read.
We both wished 'if only in the land of Oz.'
And longed for things we'd never really need.

Now we're standing in the kitchen,
All pretense is gone.
You kiss me on the shoulder.
Fireflies and songs."

Till the rays of gold and honey cover you
In the sweetness of the dawn

Through the winning, losing and trying
We'll be together

And the future is unclear

As sure as seasons are made for change
Our lifetimes are made for years
So I... I will be here

I will be here
And you can cry on my shoulder
When the mirror tells us we're older
I will hold you
And I will be here
To watch you grow in beauty
And tell you all the things you are to me
I will be here, hmmm

I will be true to the promise I have made
To you and to the One who gave you to me

348,348,Jars Of Clay,Fall Asleep,"We wandered off like children, in the woods
We let the searchers come and never find us
We tried to make a life among the trees
While your dreams collected planes and cars and cities

You slipped away from me while I was sleeping
To climb the tallest oak and see the lights
Your dissatisfaction gave you questions
Do you remember what the city sounded like?
Do you remember what the city sounded like?

So, stay up with me don't fall asleep
We only have this moment once in our lives
The next time we'll meet under city lights
But we're here tonight so, lets make it all it was meant to be

So, I held you but the cold was from inside
I knew I couldn't keep you if I tried
But I watched as the distance spread as the shadows grew
And the longings came like wolves to devour you

So, stay up with me don't fall asleep
'Cause we only have this moment once in our lives
The next time we'll meet under city lights
So, lets make it all it was meant to be"
349,349,Josh Wilson,I See God in You,"Lily Grace lives next door,
The ripe young age of ninety-four,
I see her in her garden everyday.
Still sings at the Sunday choir,
Reads up King James line by line,
And tells me ""Son, Jesus is the way.""

Her husband passed in '85,
But she still keeps their love alive.
Kisses his photograph every night,
Says ""I'll see you soon.""

Ooh Lily Grace, I see God in you.

I met him right before a show,
His mom said, ""This is Gabriel.
The doctors say he shouldn't be alive.""
Some my call him special needs,
But Jesus calls him royalty,
Just look and you'll see heaven in his eyes.

He was quiet as the dawn,
'Til I started my first song.
He clapped his hands and danced all night long,
Like there was nothing wrong.

Ooh Gabriel, I see God in you.
Ooh

Are you weary, are you weak,
Filled with insecurities?
Believe me, you are not the only one.
I get scared to look inside myself,
I know that darkness oh so well,
I sometimes wonder if I'm too far gone.

But even in my doubts I'll choose,
To hold on to this truth.
That God is making broken things brand new,
Even me and you.

Ooh I see God in you.
Ooh yeah, I see God in you.
I see God in you oh oh, I see God in you.
I see God in you oh oh, I see God in you."

And you're smiling
How my heart aches
So full it is about to break
You make me believe in love

I could never count all the ways
That you change me, Baby
Every day the sky is a deeper shade of blue
When I'm with you
When I hear you, and you're crying
It resonates, Dear
In a place I didn't know was there
You make me believe in love

I could never count all the ways
That you change me, Baby
Every day the sky is a deeper shade of blue
When I'm with you

Beautiful baby
You're sweeter than strawberry pie
Just like the morning
Your smile brings the sunshine

I could never count all the ways
That you change me, Baby

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything 
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, ohh

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me

When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me

When everything's made to be broken

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved 
And she will be loved

I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye"
471,471,The Band Perry,If I Die Young,"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh, oh oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when your really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

Will keep you by my side, will keep you from walkin' out the door

475,475,Iron & Wine,"Flightless Bird, American Mouth","I was a quick wet boy, diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair, I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map and called for you everywhere

Have I found you, flightless bird?
Jealous, weeping
Or lost you, American mouth?
Big pill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos, those fishing lures
Thrown in the cold and clean blood of Christ mountain stream

Have I found you, flightless bird?
Grounded, bleeding
Or lost you, American mouth?
Big pill, stuck going down"
476,476,Sleeping At Last,Turning Page,"I've waited a hundred years.
But I'd wait a million more for you.
Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do.

If I had only felt the warmth within your touch,
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush,
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough,
I would have known what I was living for all along.
What I've been living for.

Your love is my turning page,
Where only the sweetest words remain.
Every kiss is a cursive line,
Every touch is a redefining phrase.

I surrender who I've been for who you are,
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart.
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours,
Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along.
What I've been living for.

Though we're tethered to the story we must tell,
When I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well.
With a whisper, we will tame the vicious scenes.
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees"

I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"

On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded

And a siren wails in the night
But I'm all right 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there is light

If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
'Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me

It's confusing,
How you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul,
Yeah baby
And I'll do anything for you,
Ooh you know that much it's true
Girl I'm so in love,
I'm stupid

They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I got to,
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you,
No lie
And girl I lose it every time

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby

'Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Ooh ooh ooh
Look what you do to me

If you told me to go rock climbing
To prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying
Got everything to lose
I'm gon' try to play it cool
The stupid things I do,
I do it for you

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
'Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me"

'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep,
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

509,509,Sam Smith,Like I Can,"He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour that I don't understand 'cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Maybe he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
And stop deceiving Lord please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can"

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Ah

Oh, oh, ooh

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

You'd like to meet
To go over everything

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside

To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright"

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be

515,515,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling

And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up, I'm still looking up.

Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)

To who you are

You've picked me up and brought me far
I'm safe

For every little thing that I could not decide

And I'm joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me

I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile
You've never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things

But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you

I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans

Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland

It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly

You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months you're brought to life

And I'll whisper quietly
And give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only, you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon open wide
A small bump, in four months
You'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
And tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

Then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
When you're half asleep I'll leave you be
Right in front of me, for a couple weeks
So I could keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months, then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"
591,591,One Direction,Half a Heart,"So your friends been telling me
You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
Because I'm missing half of me

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm a half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two

If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for the lunch down by the river
We could really talk it through

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been waking up to

Only half a blue sky (Only half a blue sky)
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best (Half a man at best)

594,594,5 Seconds of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never sleep away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

No I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"

Tonight don't leave me alone.
Walk with me, come and walk with me,
To the edge of all we've ever known.

I can see you there with the city lights,
Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes.
I can breathe you in.
Two shadows standing by the bedroom door,
No, I could not want you more than I did right then,
As our heads leaned in.

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be,
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.

Stay with me, baby stay with me,
Tonight don't leave me alone.
She shows me everything she used to know,
Picture frames and country roads,
When the days were long and the world was small.
She stood by as it fell apart,
Separate rooms and broken hearts,
But I won't be the one to let you go.

Oh, I'm not sure what this is gonna be,
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.

Don't run away...

And it's hard to love again,
When the only way it's been,
When the only love you know,
Just walked away...
If it's something that you want,
Darling you don't have to run,
You don't have to go...

Just stay with me, baby stay with me.

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be,
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below. (Don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.

Oh, I'm not sure where this is gonna go,
But in this moment all I know
Is the skyline, through the window,
The moon above you and the streets below. (Baby, don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in,
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly."

I wanna love like you made me feel

God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

So pour me a drink oh love

Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

She's showing off

Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes

Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change
Me and you

Chasing it tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

Moving too fast

She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

Looking in the mirror, drop of rum on my tongue
With the warning to help me see myself clearer
I never meant to start a fire
I never meant to make you bleed
I'll be a better man today

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times that I never could

My past has tasted bitter for years now
So I wield an iron fist, grace is just a weakness
Or so I've been told
I've been cold, I've been merciless
But the blood on my hands scares me to death
Maybe I'm waking up today

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
I'll be good, I'll be good

For all of the light that I shut out
For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done all these years, no
Yeah, for all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt

I'll be good, I'll be good

All my favorite conversations
Always made in the A.M (yeah yeah)

Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?

Always made in the A.M

Trying to behave but you know that we never learned, how

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

624,624,5 Seconds of Summer,Invisible,"Another day of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away, lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Wasted days, dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
It seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? 
Invisible

Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

I can't escape, it's too late"
625,625,5 Seconds of Summer,Broken Home,"They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it's a memory now
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down

Hey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right, who's wrong, who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear, she's still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls feeling empty, they're vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you've fought
She's a scar, she's the bruising, she's the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love like a light and it's fading out

Hey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right, who's wrong, who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

You've gotta let it go, you're losing all your hope
Nothing left to hold, locked out in the cold
Your painted memories that washed out all the seams
I'm stuck in between a nightmare and lost dreams

Hey mum, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home

Hey mum, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?

627,627,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
And for always I will say

Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me

You're the reason I believe in something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so
You make it so easy

Cause you make it so easy to fall so hard

Like the rain pour in a rainstorm makes the flowers grow
You're the reason I believe in something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so

I'm only afraid that this will change

When you try to rise above me
I'll show you my own hell
I can reach right down and pull you out

If I can change this life, I would make things right
I would keep my shit together
I'll break your halo

I'm the only hope you've got to see the light, see the light
My heart grows numb as the tide rolls in, oh, oh, oh
And all the waves come crashing down, down, down, down
Swallow your dreams and the love that kept you hanging on
Without my voice you'll lose yourself

I'll break your halo
When you try to rise above me
I'll show you my own hell
I can reach right down and pull you out

If I can change this life, I would make things right
I would keep my shit together
I'll break your halo
I'm the only hope you've got

All the sins you've given it up
And we can't breathe when we're not together
What we had was just perfect enough
Taking its toll can last forever

And I would give my life, just to make things right
Got to keep my shit together
All I want is another one chance
All I need is one more broken heart
All I need is one more broken heart

I'll break your halo

'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
""Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?""
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I'm sick of the past I can't erase
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace
The mountain of things I still regret
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget (no matter where I go)

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then (now and then)
""Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?""
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face

So far from the stars
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth

Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

So far away but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, o ooh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh no
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh

What are words
If you really don't mean them
When you say them
What are words
If they're only for good times
Then they don't
When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone

And I know an angel was sent just for me
And I know I'm meant to be where I am
And I'm gonna be
Standing right beside her tonight
And I'm gonna be by your side
I would never leave when she needs me most

To the way that I need you

It feels like there's oceans 
Between me and you once again 
We hide our emotions 
Under the surface and try to pretend 
But it feels like there's oceans 
Between you and me 

I want you 
And I always will 
I wish I was worth 

But I know what you deserve 
You know I'd rather drown 
Than to go on without you 
But you're pulling me down

Between you and me once again 
We hide our emotions

Lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right
Just gotta make sence of it

When you go
I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep

And you're miles apart
I wake up with shit everything
It's just a dream

You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

Why's it only you I'm thinking of

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
You tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

Someone's moving outside
The lights come on and down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don't it feel fucked up we're not in love

I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?

These days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything we do
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?"
660,660,Drake;JAY Z,Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,"""Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...""

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
Holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us

Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake cake cake
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
Fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

Fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all warned me on
I'm the big homie, they still tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just thoughts that I share with myself
But I thought Fuck It its worth it to share it with someone else more than Paris for once"

Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure to take it tight enough if you tough

One day my voice will be heard
On every radio station cause fate rearranging and changing and this
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been tryin' to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs
But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!

Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary
I used to fuck here way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together swear to god I saw that work
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you're everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what's wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in a grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine

Slave for the
Said I'm a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I'm a mothafuckin slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine

I'm a slave for ya Nikki

669,669,Danny Brown,Grown Up,"Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Nigga catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up"

I feel that you'd be gone for good so
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said he'll be back with that same
Song that you just said you'll stay forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves have fallen
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do 
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
It seems that you're the only reason for it

I been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God
He must be mad with me it's coming
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves have fallen
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke and I poke and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more
And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last
I'mma hope, I'mma hope so the iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
It'd be grand, it's ten grammies or my granite still standing
With a note, a note that read ""granted, don't you panic""
When you make mistakes the most, the most
One day it'll make you grow, you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult, consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke, provoke
You to act manic, just stay planted
Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, what the fuck would you do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do you hear 'em love?
Do you hear 'em love? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when we mustard the gift
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

It seems that all the autumn leaves have fallen
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do

Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on

Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline
You should call it
When the last time you did something for the first time?
You have done it all, swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours

Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it

676,676,Drake;Jhene Aiko,From Time,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love"

Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere a mistress and commitment

Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?

I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretending, stop that fronting
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing
And makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl

This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build and destroy
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to

(Verse 1: Drake)
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out""

Uh -
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life, I guess."" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was all right and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get 'em""
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it ""Section.80,"" the message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit, well it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying
I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga

Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
""Am I really scared of passing away?"" If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch, I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like, ""It need to be told""
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me

Argh
(So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?
Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga
Like, nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga, we can go back right now)
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit
My brother, homie

Tired of running, tired of hunting
My own kind but retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

How many sins? I'm running out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of balling like Spalding but only shotty bounce
The reaper calling, I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power), yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doing? Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lying 'bout comin'
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding, the beef is bubblin'
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

Too many sins, I'm running out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, are stress days
Lord, forgive me for all my sins for I not know
My best days, are stress days
Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed, what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling

Back once my momma say
""See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""

I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit
That's my brother, homie)
Young man, come talk to me
Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry? See you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of The Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me

Lord God, I come to you a sinner (Lord God, I come to you a sinner)
And I humbly repent for my sins (And I humbly repent for my sins)
I believe that Jesus is Lord (I believe Jesus is Lord)
I believe you raised him from the dead (I believe you raised him from the dead)
I would ask that Jesus come into my life (I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
And to be my Lord and Savior (And to be my Lord and Savior)
I receive Jesus to take control of my life (I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
And that I may live with him from this day forward (And that I may live with him from this day forward)
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood (Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood)
In Jesus name, amen (In Jesus name, amen)
All right now, remember this day, the start of a new life
Your real life"

At times I feel as though I'm caught up In a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop (off top)
But you know we only go till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up
This the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up
And bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar ladies get a drink
Nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights off
And put my number in it

I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you like Where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time
I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind is letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girls 100
And I want it, no question
I know destiny well and know I seen the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams

I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promise land but
I can't do no promising
I can't do no promising

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga

690,690,Eminem,Deja Vu,"[Intro: Male Medic]
DMC, we have a mid-30's male found down, unresponsive. Possible overdose, substance unknown.
Pulse is 60 and thready. Respiration's 8. He's intubated, and we're bagging him now.
Uhh, BP: 90 over palp. Patient is cool, pale, and diuretic.
Has aspirated. Uhh, GSC is 3. We'll update en route.
ETA: ten minutes.

As I, fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate

Start off with the NyQuil like ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that, then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, ""Yeah, that's great.""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight

Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face ""Mommy something is wrong with dad I think

He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat""

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew ""What's a beer?""
That's the Devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fucking hear
""Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""

And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine

Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out, 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all

Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?
Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
""All systems ready for take off please stand by""

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die

Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helping you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self-inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?

Now here I am three months later, full blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, Holmes. Relax""
And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he

Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing
It was bologna was it the methadone, ya think

Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with you Amb!en CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie,
""I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina""

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
Damn

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know"

Uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say
""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today""
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today""
And I heard 'em say
""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today""
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)

Kanye West:
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And gram keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Kanye West and Adam Levine:
Uh, and I heard 'em say
""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today""
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe

Billionaires with Petroleum and coal money
Probably kill themselves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Popoff off robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club 'cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke 'cause we don't know money
Spend it before we get it and could never hold money

Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha

And my bitch called talkin' bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party

Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you 'cause

We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party

Shit just got real, things are getting intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me
Telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking
Like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once

We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight

You no hear me yet?
Hear me live and direct
Walk with your tap

Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
Cause shit is different now
It's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets
Y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare - I just don't go outside
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday
With a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt
We call that champagne

Come some more into my sight..."

In this life, life

One too many years
So taste what I lived on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it's over in no time the best life

I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're smaller and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine

I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it

Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me of Novocaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do

735,735,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Leave it to the breeze

To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother (Hey!)
To supply all of my heart's demands

751,751,Alessia Cara,Wild Things,"To me, 'where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. It's a place of liberty and shamelessness. It can take a split second of our lifetime to find it, but once you do you'll be free.

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

There's a wild thing that exists in all of us, it lives in our passions and the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs... It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... We have to become it."

Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to CÃ©ilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

There's something in the way you move

It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
Don't know what it is you do

Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

There's an evil night air
The stars don't shine tonight
Something in the way you do
Something in the way you

Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing left for me to lose

There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall

Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

Maybe I am just not enough

By lying and tearing us up

The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright

In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows

We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know

So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets

So let's take our time to say what we want
Here's what we got before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
And I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

Hey
Whoa

I'm gonna love you (oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me

Holding me close until our eyes meet

Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed

And now all this time
Is passing by

It hurts me every time I see you

Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come, come on now follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Well I'm in love with your body

(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on

Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on
Come on be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go
I always know

I'm in love with someone but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

Don't be mean if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection
All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it

Give it time, c'mon babe it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work know it hurts but I'll go there
Do the same can you show me that you care
God I hope so but I don't think so

Don't be mean if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home

All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

I won't breathe
I won't move till you finally see
That you belong with me

You might think I don't look
But deep inside in the corner of my mind
I'm attached to you

I'm weak, it's true
'Cause I'm afraid to know the answer
Do you want me too?
Cause my heart keeps falling faster

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
So I will not hide
It's time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited
This is true

You don't know what you do
Everytime you walk into the room
I'm afraid to move

I'm weak, it's true
I'm just scared to know the ending
Do you see me too?
Do you even know you met me?

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
So I will not hide
It's time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

I know when I go
I'll be on my way to you

I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time
'Cause I like me better when

Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on, aren't we?

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me, got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive

Thought we were holding on, aren't we?

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me, got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I've realized
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know!

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen

Please don't scar this young heart
Just take my hand

I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you

Hold me close through the night
Don't let me go, we'll be alright
Touch my soul and hold it tight
I've been waiting all my life
I won't scar your young heart
Just take my hand

829,829,Jason Mraz,I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
830,830,Lukas Graham,7 Years,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old"

I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I'll wanna take it back and start again
Most nights I pray for you to come home
Praying to the Lord
Praying for my soul

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

(Oh oh oh)
I send so many messages you don't reply
(Oh oh oh)
I gotta figure out what am I missing babe
Singing now (Oh oh oh)
And I need you now, I need your love
(Oh oh oh)

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't
Please don't go

Please don't go

839,839,Little Mix;Jason Derulo,Secret Love Song,"When you hold me in the street 
And you kiss me on the dance floor 
I wish that it could be like that 
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

When you're with him, do you call his name,
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

Girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we're making
I'm living for that day, someday

Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours!

Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftops
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't we be like that?
Wish we could be like that"

Across the water across the deep blue ocean

I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you I promise you I will

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday"

And the stars, they broke their code

How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

If we get no rest, till the sunrise.
Until you make me fall in love again, as light shows your face, I could never be the same
I plan to love you all my life,
Until you meet your chariot

What would I do without your eyes,
The way they look at me and mine,
And when your smile creates that dimple,
I tend to be used as your pillow,

Pre-So just breath,
Breath in, release you know that's all you need,

And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, ""Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.'
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love

And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

(And all my brothers and my sisters yeah)

And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love"

(Oh if you could see me now)

It was February 14 Valentines Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
And explained I was young, he would say
Take that rage, put it on a page
Take that page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying ""That's my kid!""

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see me now would you recognize me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on my heart that was cold
As the day you were taken away
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me
Like I won't know real love till I've loved and I've lost it
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

Oh, oh
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, oh
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Yeah I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I've got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best

But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

She's in line at the door with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine

871,871,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

872,872,The Fray,You Found Me,"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?

To find me, to find me?"

877,877,Nickelback,If Today Was Your Last Day,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day,
If today was your last day.

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day...
Would you make your mark
By mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars,
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here.""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows.
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go.""

People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl
Oh whoa
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved

I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed, still stuck in that time
When we called it love

Man, fuck that shit, I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I go away, got what you was looking for, now It's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

I'm here without you, baby

Might get scraped or they might get bruised

That's why it's called the moment of truth, yeah

When you heard what I told you
When you get worried I'll be your soldier

At the last moment when you're supposed to charge
Always on the longest yard
Oh, they feel their feet get cold

Hiding here, hiding there
Find them underneath the stairs
People hiding everywhere
Trying to be still like a stone but

I'd get it if you need it
I'll search if you can't see it
You're thirsty I'll be rain
You get hurt I'll take your pain

I know you don't believe it

When you heard what I told you
When you get worried I'll be your soldier

As if no one knows anything but us

Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

That I've ever known

Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter what, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.

You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's... that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is."

All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart

Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you

When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk to much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You coulda rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Coulda walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time"
898,898,James Vincent McMorrow,We Don't Eat,"If this is redemption, why do I bother at all
There's nothing to mention, and nothing has changed
Still I'd rather be working at something, than praying for the rain
So I wander on, till someone else is saved

I moved to the coast, under a mountain
Swam in the ocean, slept on my own
At dawn I would watch the sun cut ribbons through the bay
I'd remember all the things my mother wrote

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Two thousand years, I've been in that water
Two thousand years, sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets
That the fishermen have thrown
Trying to find, a little bit of hope

Me I was holding, all of my secrets soft and hid
Pages were folded, then there was nothing at all
So if in the future I might need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Am I an honest man and true
Have I been good to you at all
Oh I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines, the same old stories of
Breathless trains and, worn down glories
Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own

So we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you my friend, I'd learn to have just a little bit of trust"
899,899,John Mayer,Say,"Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Walking like a one-man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You better know that in the end 
It's better to say too much 
Than never to say what you need to say

Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say"
900,900,Passenger,Let Her Go,"Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go"

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say

You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Are said too much
They're not enough

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio

Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation
I know that much is understood

And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

It's so untrue
I can't even convince myself
When I'm speaking,
It's the voice of someone else

Oh it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Oh the truth hurts
A lie's worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before

Oh what are we doing
We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us

Running back through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train when it's too late (too late)

Oh it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel

Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?

They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own

And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing

That one man could change the world

It's all good I love you grandma

You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

Hope that it went out, but it's burning just the same.

You gotta love somebody, to love them all the same.
Singing, oh, I feel your heartbeat, oh.

I'm trying to put it all back together.
I've got a story and I'm trying to tell it right.
I got the kerosene and a desire.
I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night

And I don't want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Just a drop in the ocean,
A change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep,
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

A drop in the ocean,

Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old

And we'll lose our winter coats in the spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings
'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
Scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh, I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

Oh

'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet, no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me

Oh, but I don't wanna know
But who will take you home
Who will take you home
Who will take you home
If I let you go

Oh

And now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love if you don't
No you don't
So I won't say I love you if you don't"

It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back"
936,936,Eminem,Mockingbird,"Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"
939,939,James Bay,Incomplete,"I breathe in slow to compose myself
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
Started speeding round, beating half to death
'Cause you're here and you're all mine

So I press my lips down into your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery I've been trying to be perfect
It can wait for a while

Scared of hope in my head it's been making me sweat but it turns out
You're here with your head on my chest
I should've guessed

The world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incomplete

I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your lungs push slow against my skin
Let it all feel just fine

Gone is the emptiness
We just take what's best and we move on
All that the hurt gets left
I should've guessed

The world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
This here now, it's where we touch down
You and me let's be incomplete

How'd we go without
I don't know it's look like we've made it again
Tell me you'll never look down, down

And the world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incom...

I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the cloud
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now

I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now

And the world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
This here now it's where we touch down

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still sound like a song

Well they forgot
This world keeps spinning

And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and

Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia-tone loving
Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions of my heart
Like why we're here? 'nd where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy,
No, Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

Mmm it's always better when we're together
Yeah we look at them stars when we're together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
And brings new things
But tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, It's always better when we're together
Mmm We're somewhere in between together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"
1039,1039,Of Monsters and Men,Little Talks,"I don't like walkin' around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keepin' me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothin' we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now, wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore"
1041,1041,John Mayer,Waiting On the World to Change,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change"

We both retreat to opposing stands
And the love lives on without us

Love will find a way

You make it easier when life gets hard

Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you I promise you I will

Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

That someday it would lead me back to you

See we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say

It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, it could be the stars falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

I never seen it, but I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe I'm gonna treat it
Better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful

Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts, lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, it could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out 'cause we shook-a-shook-a shine down
Even when the, when the light's out but I can see you blow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do

And I don't think that I'll see her again

It's like we're chasing all those stars

Seen it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no, so

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Got no reason 
Got no shame 
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear 
I'mma tell you everything

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

All my secrets away

All my secrets away"
1062,1062,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1063,1063,Mindy Gledhill,Pocketful of Poetry,"I don't do well if I'm kept behind
This office desk inside
It makes me loose my mind
Which wanders endlessly
Where all the birds fly freely
With their silhouettes
In perfect symmetry

I got a pocketful of poetry
I've got a head full of songs
A heart with wings
You couldn't tie me down to anything
And that's enough for me

I draw doodles of eccentric faces
In the margin spaces
Of important papers
Then I hand them in
With a comedic grin
They ask if I need help
Oh, where do I begin'

I got a pocketful of poetry
I've got a head full of songs
A heart with wings
You couldn't tie me down to anything
And that's enough for me

People all good lovingly they tell me
Do as you should, all will be well, they say
Life is a test, please give the best answer
A or B or C, pick one instantly
What if there's so much more to me'

I got a pocketful of poetry
I've got a head full of songs
A heart with wings
You couldn't tie me down to anything
And that's enough for me"
1065,1065,Loggins & Messina,Danny's Song,"People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one,
And we've only just begun.
Think I'm gonna have a son.
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove,
Conceived in love.
Sun is gonna shine above.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi,
Never got high.
Oh, I was a sorry guy.
And now, I smile and face the girl that shares my name.
Now I'm through with the game.
This boy will never be the same.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign,
Strong and kind,
And the little boy is mine.
Now I see a family where the once was none.
Now we've just begun.
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup.
Drink it up.
Love her and she'll bring you luck.
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home.
Don't you live alone.
Try to earn what lovers own.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright."

And the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light
I'm ignoring all the signs

I keep on frontin'
Yeah I stay bluffin'
I keep you wonderin', keep you huntin' for my lovin'
But I crave us huggin'
Yeah I stay stubborn
'Cause I can't admit that you got got all the strings
And know just how to tug 'em

I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)

Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

My heart's pacin', I'm confused, I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you, it's got me shakin'
I must be halucinatin'
I hear it happens, I'm just sayin'
Babe I'm just sayin'

Someone give me some paper
Someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child
I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust you when you say ""give me a hand""
Baby I'm fallin', I hope you catch me when I land

In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the dutchess
And your blunts are always loose so I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we getting so high, we always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches that turn into late lunches
And we ain't gotta label, we're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly and tell you do some crunches
And you say ""Yeah well your ass jiggles, go and do some lunges""
I say ""Fuck you"" while I'm thinking of you as my husband
I think I'm in love

I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
Baby I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again (My head, yeah you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
I think I'm in love again"
1068,1068,Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even

She finally met a man who's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake, she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even, even, no

When the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up that you're okay?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding

When I'm all choked up that you're okay

I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
('Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even)

Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase, I took the blame
Now I'm tryin' to make sense of what little remains
Oh 'cause you left me with no love, and no love to my name

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a god that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks no, it don't break
No it don't break, no it don't break even no

What am I gonna do
When the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up and you're okay?

I'm falling to pieces, yeah

I hold the love that you bring

And the colors are golden and bright again
There's a song in my heart, I feel like I belong
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along

I see the whole world in your eyes
It's like I've known you all my life
We just feel so right
So I pour my heart into your hands
It's like you really understand
You love the way I am

And I hold my favorite thing
I hold the happiness you bring
But it feels like I've opened my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
And the sun paints the skies and the wind sings our song
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along

And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

1086,1086,James Bay,Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"
1087,1087,Maroon 5,Won't Go Home Without You,"I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, ohh
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath, I'll never get over 
And the noises that she made kept me awake, ohh
The weight of the things that remain unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe it

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Ohh, it's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you, ohh

Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go

It's not over tonight 
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Ohh, it's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you

1089,1089,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

It's ripping me apart

In a dark room, in cold sheets

Your medicine is in my head

You know I'd rather be alone
But then you call me on the phone

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

I tell myself I like that
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident, I'll give you that
But if you love yourself, you can f*** yourself

'Cause I'd rather be alone
But you fermented in my bones

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart

Watching the tide roll away, ooh
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
Look like nothing's gonna come my way

So, I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, listen

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home, now

I'm just gon' sit at the dock of a bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, ""Why are we here?"" and ""Where do we go?""
And ""How come it's so hard?""
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of the dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me

There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"

Nothing stings as much like never knowing
What you've been up to, whose bed your crashing now
I wanna get rid of the feeling, turn it all around
'Cause I've been nothing but good to you
Your howlin' into the night won't do
I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking
I've been nothing but good to you

Get out the door and disappear
When you'll get home I won't be here
Don't act surprised as if you care
Don't even bother cause
I've been nothing but good to you
Your howlin' into the night won't do
I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking

And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song...

Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love

Come on love, love, love

Give me shelter or show me heart
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart"
1102,1102,James Taylor,Fire And Rain,"Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought they would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Fire and rain, now"
1104,1104,John Mayer,Daughters,"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too"

Can I swim in your divine?

With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Oh, only to wake and hide your face

When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

But oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name

1109,1109,Niall Horan,This Town,"Waking up to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It's funny how things never change in this old town

So far from the stars
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth

Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

It's so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

'Cause if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it's wrong
That I can't move on
But there's something about you
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth

Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you

Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

(Everything comes back to you)"
1111,1111,MGMT,Kids,"You were a child crawling on your knees toward it
Making mama so proud but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it

'Cause the truth is out, I've realized
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know!

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in

Promise me (Ah, ah, ah)
That you'll leave the light on (Ah, ah, ah)
To help me see (Ah, ah, ah)
With daylight, my guide, gone (Ah, ah, ah)

'Cause I believe, there's a way (Ah, ah, ah)
You can love me because I say I won't write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one (Mhm)
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this

Is that why you wanted, a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this
If you're on your way (Oh, oh)
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute (for a minute)
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today (write you a love song today)
Today, yeah"
1131,1131,Kodaline,All I Want,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

Ooh

If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
All I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh"
1132,1132,Sara Bareilles,I Choose You,"Let the bough break let it come down crashing
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
Can't say I'd even notice it was absent
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
I'll unfold before you
What I've strung together
The very first words of a lifelong love letter

Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you

There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me you could not come true, just love's illusion
But then you found me and everything changed
And I believe in something again
My whole heart will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter

Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you

We are not perfect we'll learn from our mistakes and as long as it takes I will
Prove my love to you
I am not scared of the elements I am underprepared but I am willing
And even better, I get to be the other half of you

Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you"
1133,1133,Kris Allen,Live Like We're Dying,"Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you,"" enough
Till it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

Like we're dying (x4)

You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till its head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it's gone

Like we're dying (x4)"
1134,1134,Andy Grammer,Fine By Me,"You're not the type 
Type of girl to remain 
With the guy, with the guy too shy 
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever

I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees 
With his hands clenched tight 
Begging, begging you please 
To stay with him for worse and for better 

But I'm staring at you now 
There's no one else around 
I'm thinking you're the girl for me 

I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 

In the past I would try 
Try hard to commit to a girl 
Wouldn't get too far 
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart 

And with you, you, you 
I can see what I need 
I can dream realistically 
I knew that this was different from the start 

And it seems that every time 
We're eye to eye 
I can find another piece of you 
That I don't wanna lose 

And I'm staring at you now 
There's no one else around 
I'm thinking you're the girl I need 

I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 

I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 

And it's never easy 
Darling, believe me 
I'm as skeptical as you 
When I think of life without 'us' 
She's like ""What we supposed to do?"" 
But I don't wanna come on too strong 

I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
We can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 

It's fine by me if you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me

I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If we never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me"

I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes

Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you, that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room

But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do

I'd live for you and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you

But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming
Like who would you live for, who would you die for
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

1137,1137,Macklemore;Kesha,Good Old Days (feat. Kesha),"I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days"

Not to tell you

I'm scared of what you'll say

And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance

All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

1139,1139,Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America"

When you wake up I
Like to believe you are
Thinking of me
And when the sun comes
Through your window I
Like to believe you've been
Dreaming of me

Dreaming, mmm

I know
'Cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in
I should know
'Cause I'd spend
Oh the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew I
Liked the affect that you
Had on my eyes
But no one else heard
The way of your words
Or felt the affect that they
Have on my mind

Falling, mmm

'Cause I've spent

Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in

Oh the whole day

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)

Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, all ways are changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?

Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone?

So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all (come on yeah)

Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images, is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas

Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)

Where is the love?

One world, one world (That's all we got)
One world, one world
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah

Nothing can compare to where you send me

And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack 
And just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun

Dizzy in my head, spin like a record

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool

That will soon be memory

You know a melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come in through to soothe me

Dodgin all of the pot holes, in my auto-mobile hollerin' out watch out
We lost hope like Bob Hope, so what are we supposed to follow?
I'm a leader not an apostle, but I believe in the freedom that god holds
(Shit) I'm on the top rope, ready to jump so watch close
Been criticized and boxed out since I was a snot nosed kid
We ain't livin' for tomorrow we live for the lord though
Everybody tryin' to fit in the crowd like where's Waldo?
I freeze time like photographs livin' for the moment
I'm taking mental pictures reminiscing while I'm smokin'
When I see the the light of day right away ill ride away
'Cause things I write and say give me direction like Michael Bay
I need somethin' in my life because my plans, they never work out
Like when I make plans to work out 'cause everything don't always turn out like you want them to, honest truth
Nah ain't nothin' wrong with Luke go walk this path alone but I need somebody here to talk me through, but who?

3 foot tall
Like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall
When there's no one there to catch your fall


I know I have my unity, community, but everyone that I did music with over the years disappeared, when they're ain't too many still doin' this
Feeling like I've gone to war, lost my soldiers on the journey
Feeling like we built a team but ONLY I WEAR THE JERSEY yeah
Everything comes and goes, I dealt with the undertow
Keeping my head above the water, pushed on, now I run the show
I know this situations never perfect deal with what you got
Never bite your tongue, tell your piece don't let them shut you up
They say everything about money, nah only business
If your friends think that, then you hang round money hungry bitches
The world is hollow y'all need to eat up I'm makin' a pot roast
These people are all over themselves and I ain't in to feeding no cockroach.
Roller right, I know the type don't be a dick head
'Cause everything comes full circle jerk get it?
I ain't looking for the exit, I'm tryin' to show you where my head is
When you feel alone play my song and that keeps us connected.
Check it

When you're alone, life can be a little rough. It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall.
When its just you, well times can be tough.
When there's no one there to catch your fall
3 foot tall
Like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall
When there's no one there to catch your fall"

Hope when the moment comes
You'll say...

I, I did it all
I owned every second
That this world could give
I saw so many places
And things that I did
Of every broken bone
I swear I lived

Hope that you spend your days

And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
I wish that I could witness
All your joy
And all your pain

Then he broke that mold so I know I'm blessed in the name of God

Stand up now and face the sun
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
It's time to do what must be done
Be a king when kingdom comes

I'll be the teacher, you could be the lesson
I'll be the preacher, you be the confession
I'll be the quick relief to all your stressing (This is my world)
It's a thin line between love and hate
Is you really real or is you really fake?
I'm a soldier standing on my feet
No surrender and I won't retreat (This is my world)

Stand up now and face the sun
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
It's time to do what must be done
Be a king when kingdom comes

1167,1167,The Neighbourhood,Sweater Weather,"And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand

Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away

The goosebumps start to race
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watched your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats' heart is for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No no no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

1169,1169,Maroon 5,This Love,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before 
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore..."

Oh he really doesn't share
Although it's more than he can handle
Life is anything but fair, life is anything but fair

Just as soon as they turn older
He'll come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
L the hidden love beneath

Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay - me down

All alone, alone again
No one lends a helping hand
I have waited, I have waited
Takes it's toll, one's foolish pride
How long before I see the light
I have waited, I have waited
For you to lay me down

Sail on by, sail on by for now
They play naked in the water
You know it's hard, heaven knows I've tried
But it just keeps getting harder

So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay - me down

You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

You got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
I want to stop now
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Riding on my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down

Down to my core

Surprised when you caught me off guard
Hard as damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it
No you said it
No you said it
We'd be together

But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

But I'd wait a million more for you.
Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do.

If I had only felt the warmth within your touch,
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush,
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough,
I would have known what I was living for all along.
What I've been living for.

Your love is my turning page,
Where only the sweetest words remain.
Every kiss is a cursive line,
Every touch is a redefining phrase.

I surrender who I've been for who you are,
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart.
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours,
Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along.
What I've been living for.

Though we're tethered to the story we must tell,
When I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well.
With a whisper, we will tame the vicious scenes.
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees"

And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me

Someday we'll all be gone

They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be"

I want your flowers
Like babies want God's love
Or maybe as sure as
Tomorrow will come

Some days like rain on the doorstep
She'll cover me with grace in all she offers
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her
What honest words she can't afford to say

Like I want your flowers

Tomorrow will come"

I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone beat down on bony backs
So far from home where the ocean stood 
Down dust and pine cone tracks

We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog where all around us 
The bloom of summertime

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags, 
I've come to know the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone 
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls now.

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.

We grow, grow, steady as the morning
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, steady as the flowers
We grow, grow, older still
We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow, older still"

We lost faith, in the arms of love.

Where you been hiding lately, where you been hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately, we've been fighting with the wolves.
With the wolves.
Red tongues and hands.

Falling from high places, falling through lost spaces,
Now that we're lonely, now that we're so far from home.
Watching from both sides, these towers been tumbling down,
I lost my mind here, I lost my patience with the lord.

We lost faith, oh in the arms of love

Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Watch me fall apart

Darling I feel you under my body
Darling you're with me forever and always
Give me shelter or show me heart
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart"
1223,1223,Ben Howard,Keep Your Head Up,"I spent my time, watching
The spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind on the second best
Oh the scars that come with the greenness
And I gave my eyes to the boredom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I try my best to embrace the darkness
In which I swim

Now walking back, down this mountain
The strength of a turnin' tide
Oh the wind so soft, and my skin
Yeah the sun so hot upon my side
Oh lookin' out at this happiness
I searched for between the sheets
Oh feelin' blind, I realize
All I was searchin' for, was me
Oh oh-oh, all I was searchin' for was me

Oh yeah, keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no, keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin', keep your head up, keep your heart strong
Na, oh, no, no, keep your mind set in your ways
Keep your heart strong

Now I saw a friend of mine, the other day
And he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh I said I'd been away, and he knew...
Oh he knew the depths I was meanin'
And it felt so good to see his face
All the comfort invested in my soul
Oh to feel the warmth, of his smile
When he said, ""I'm happy to have you home""
Oh oh-oh, I'm happy to have you home

Oh yeah, keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no, keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin', keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no, keep your mind set in your ways
Well, keep your heart strong

'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh eyes like wildflowers, oh with your demons of change

That my time here's a little unclear
I've been worrying
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worrying
That we all live our lives in the confines of fear

My my cold hearted child, tell me how you feel
Just a grain in the morning air, dark shadow on the hill
My my cold hearted child, tell me where it all falls
This apathy you feel will make a fool of us all

See I've been worrying
That my time here's a little unclear
I've been worrying
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear

And the river's cracked and cold

A darkened plume to stay
Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place

No man is an island, this I know
But can't you see or...?
Or maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to hold
Comfort came against my will
And every story must grow old

Still I'll be a traveller
A gypsy's reins to face
But the road is wearier
With that fool found in your place

No man is an island, this I know
But can't you see or...?
Or maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

No man is an island, this I know

Really don't mind the practice

Ringing it's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to we got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of you're arms
Don't really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow, mmm mmm, wake up slow

Learning loving somebody
Don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you
Maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines because they're directed at you
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
You keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long
But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel

Ain't so easy to do

What's impossible
Well they forgot
This world keeps spinning
And with each new day

I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and

Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
I don't want this feeling to go away

1230,1230,Jack Johnson,Better Together,"There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams they are made up of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia-tone loving
Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions of my heart
Like why we're here? 'nd where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy,
No, Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

Mmm it's always better when we're together
Yeah we look at them stars when we're together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
And brings new things
But tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, It's always better when we're together
Mmm We're somewhere in between together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"

But I'm not the only one.
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one.

Imagine there's no countries,
It isn't hard to do.
Nothing to kill,
Or die for.
No religion too.

Imagine all the people,
Livin' the life for peace.

But I'm not the only one.

No need for greed or hunger,
A brotherhood of man.

Sharing all the world.

1232,1232,Jack Johnson,Do You Remember,"Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
It was some time in early September
You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you, I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

But I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all, over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Well all those times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember?"
1233,1233,Jack Johnson,No Other Way,"When your mind is a mess
So is mine
I can't sleep
Cause it hurts when I think
My thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make
Chances we take
They're, not yours and not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we say
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen
Cause the world is awake
For somebody's sake now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew
All of the answers I would
Not hold them from you'd
Know all the things that I know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting I can hear it in the way that your breathing
We don't really need to find reason
Cause out the same door that it came well it's leaving it's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we will find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

And know that if I knew
All of the answers I would
Not hold them from you'd
Know all the things that I know
We told each other, there is no other way"
1234,1234,Jack Johnson,Good People,"You win, it's your show now
So what's it gonna be?
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see?

We thought this was low
It's bad gettin' worse, ah

Where'd all the good people go
I've been changin' channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle-a-tat
Testing one two,
Now whatcha gonna do?
Bad news, misused, got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now who's side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way, now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changin' channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting round feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
It's important to you is not important to me
Way down by the edge of your reasons
It's beginning to show
And all I really wanna know is...

Where'd all the good people go
I've been changin' channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that

Station to station desensitizing the nation
Going Going Gone..."
1237,1237,Passenger,All the Little Lights,"One went out at a bus stop in Edinburgh
One went out in an English park
One went out in a nightclub when I was fifteen
Little lights in my heart

One went out when I lied to my mother
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine
One went out within me
Now I smoke like a chimney
It's getting dark in this heart of mine
It's getting dark in this heart of mine

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up
Every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away

One went out in the backstreets of Manchester
One went out in an airport in Spain
One went out, I've no doubt, when I grew up and moved out
Of the place where the boy used to play

One went out when Uncle Ben got his tumour
We used to fish and I fish no more
Though he will not return
I know one still burns
On a fishing boat off the New Jersey shore
On a fishing boat off the New Jersey shore

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up
Every time we feel love in our hearts
One dies when it moves away

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in our hearts
And they die along the way
Till we're old and we're cold
And we're lying in the dark
'Cause they'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day, all
They'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day, yeah, no"
1238,1238,Passenger,Life's for the Living,"Well, grey clouds
Wrapped 'round the town like elastic
Cars stood like toys
Made of Taiwanese plastic
The boy laughed at the spastic
Dancing around in the rain

While laundrettes cleaned clothes
High heals rubbed toes
Puddles splashed huddles
Of bus stop crows
Dressed in their suits and their boots
Well, they all looked the same

I took myself down to the cafe
To find all
The boys lost in books and
Crackling vinyl
And carved out a poem
Above the urinal that read

Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead

While the evening
Pulled the moon out of it's packet
Stars shone like buttons
On an old man's jacket
We needed a nail
But we tacked it 'til it fell of the wall

While pigeon's pecked trains
Sparks flew like planes
The rain showed the rainbows
In the oil stains
And we all had new iPhones
But no one had no one to call

And I stumbled down
To the stomach of the town
Where the widow takes memories
To slowly drown
With a hand to the sky
And a mist in her eye, she said

Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead

Well, I'm sick of this town
This blind man's forage
They take your dreams down
And they stick 'em in storage
You can have 'em back, son
When you've paid off your mortgage and loans

Oh, hell with this place
I'll go it my own way
I'll stick out my thumb
And I trudge down the highway
Someday, someone
Must be going my way, home

'Til then I'll make my bed
From a disused car
With a mattress of leaves
And a blanket of stars
And I'll stitch the words into my heart
With a needle and thread

Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
You know life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead

Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead"
1239,1239,Passenger,The Wrong Direction,"When I was a kid, the things I did
Were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed
That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Well it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no
Seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh"
1240,1240,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"

Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure

Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?

Before you even caught my eye
No I can't bear to see this die
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
I've used all my farewells

You've been seeing her
With her pretty eyes
And her lovely lies
And I've been waiting here
I've been killing time
Hoping you will be mine
Darling I should've said goodbye
Before you even caught my eye
No I can't better see this die
Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
I've used all my farewells

Thirteen sad farewells my darling
Thirteen sad farewells
I will see you no more darling
You have used all your farewells
You have used all your farewells
You have used all your farewells"
1243,1243,Cage The Elephant,Cigarette Daydreams,"Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now

You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

Do do do, do do do

You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall

Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Do do do, do do do

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

Do do, do, do, do
Do do, do, do, do
Do do, do, do, do

You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain"
1244,1244,Trevor Hall,The Lime Tree,"Spark a match and watch the candle burn
The wick runs out and love takes its turn
On fallen angels and broken sounds
We will last past the final round
It took a while for you to find me
Because I was hiding in the lime tree
Above the city in the rain cloud
I poked a hole and watched it drain out
Parallel to the city streets
Our broken crowns beneath our feet
But as we walk across the diamonds
We know that love is always shining
So save me love save me all the time
I'll wash you down with a simple sip of wine
And toast my glass to all my loved ones
To let them know that the stars well they still shine"

Everyone leans on her windowpane but no one looks in
She's so far from home
But only the starlight can turn this town cold
And lonely is a lifetime of getting used to being alone
So where do you go?
The street lights come with a cool breeze and she waits all night
And just before the morning sunlight, she breaks down and cries
She's trying to make it right
But only the starlight can turn this town cold
And lonely is a lifetime of getting used to being alone
So where do you go?
And only the starlight can turn this town cold
And lonely is a lifetime of getting used to being alone
So where do you go?"
1251,1251,Passenger,Riding To New York,"Well I met him in Minnesota
He was dark and overcast
With long, grey hair and eyes that stared
Through me like I was glass
I asked, ""Where are you going to?""
He said, ""I'm the wind, I'm just blowing through""
He lit up a cigarette and began to talk

See, the doctors told me that my body won't hold me
My lungs are turning black
Been a lucky strike's fool since I was at school
And there ain't no turning back
They can't tell me how long I've got
Maybe months, but maybe not
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York

'Cause I wanna see my granddaughter one last time
Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny
Heart beat next to mine
Wanna see my son and the man he's become
Tell him, I'm sorry for the things I've done
And I'd do it if I had to walk
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York

Through the forests of Wisconsin
That I knew as a boy
Past the sky line of Chicago
'Round the lakes of Illinois
I lay my head in a motel bed
Where my back is sore and my eyes turn red
And listen to the trucks roll past my door

Through the fields of Ohio
As the sunshine paints them gold
I run like a river runs
Rapid, quick and cold
And fly through Pennsylvania
And the Jersey turnpike tolls
And I won't stop 'til I get to New York

'Cause I wanna see my grandson one last time
Wanna see his eyes sparkling
And stare back into mine
Now my time is shorter, I wanna see my daughter
Tell her, I'm sorry for the things I taught her
And I'd do it if I had to walk
Oh I'm taking this bike, I'm riding to New York

And I'd go up to the churchyard
One last time
Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me
The best years of my life
And I'd do it if I had to walk
I'd do it if I had to walk
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York"

Broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside, my hope torn apart

But the ghosts that we knew
Will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

So give me hope in the darkness
That I will see the light
Cause oh, they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be alright

So lead me back, turn south from that place
And close my eyes, to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call, and will share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

So give me hope in the darkness
That I will see the light
Cause oh, they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be alright

But hold me still, bury my heart on the cold
And hold me still, bury my heart next to yours

So give me hope in the darkness
That I will see the light
Cause oh, they gave me such a fright
But I will hold on with all of my might
Just promise me we'll be alright

Made us black and all blue

Will never run through your skin
And those bright blue eyes
Can only meet mine
Across a room filled with people
That are less important than you

When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you

So I think it's best
We both forget
Before we dwell on it
The way you held me so tight
All through the night
Till it was near mornin'

I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
You are someone else, I am still right here

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt

If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way"

Go and tell that midnight rider 
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter 
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down 
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down 

Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news 
My head's been wet with the midnight dew 
I've been down on bended knee
Talkin' to the man from Galilee 
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet 
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet 
He called my name and my heart stood still 
When he said ""John, go do my will!"" 

Go tell that long-tongue liar 
Go and tell that midnight rider 
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter 
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Ooh [x6]

And these wings aren't for flying

1258,1258,Lisa Hannigan,Little Bird,"Your heart sings like a kettle
And your words, they boil away like steam.
A lie burns long while the truth bites quick,
A heart is built for both it seems.
You are lonely as a church,
Despite the queueing out your door.
I am empty as a promise no more.

When the time comes,
And rights have been read,
I think of you often
But for once I meant what I said.

I was salted by your hunger,
Now you've gone and lost your appetite
And a little bird is every bit as handy in a fight
I am lonely as a memory
Despite the gathering round the fire.
Aren't you every bird on every wire?

When the time comes,
And rights have been read,
I think of you often
But for once I meant what I said.

Here I stay, I lay me down,
In a house by the Hill.
Dug from the rubble, cut from the kill."
1259,1259,NEEDTOBREATHE,Able,"There's a host of hurts we come across
None of which alike
From the air inside the birthing room
To the darkness where we die
Though I feel I'm just as strong as any man I know
I'm not able on my own

Carry 'round the secrets
Only heaven knows
Crawl into our darkened rooms where only victims go
Though I feel I'm strong enough to carry all this load
I'm not able on my own

All my actions, false or true
Selfish motives I will use
We were born with knives in hand
Trained to kill our fellow man
If we're not better than the rest
How will children do their best
Find your patience, find your truth
Love is all we have to lose
I'm not able on my own"
1261,1261,Dan Croll,Home,"I've forgotten how it feels with the carpet under my seat
It's the polyester fibers that wrap around my feet
Feels like home, home

When the cold shakes my bones it's the rug that warms my soul
It's the textile to the skin, and the sensation alone feels like home, home

So if you ever come 'round to my house take your shoes off at the door
'Cause it's impolite not to; you'll be damaging my floor
'Cause it's my home

When you're down and you're alone it's the train that brings you home
And your mother, brother, sister, father, waitin' at the door
It's so sweet, sweet

Makes me glad I'm only a stone's throw away
Makes me sad that others can't have it the same way
Oh, home, home

In the forest it's unlikely that you'll find a home so tidy
Compared to what it's like living like a city type
Why, it's no home"
1262,1262,Ruth B.,Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling

You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so

1263,1263,Dan Wilson,Breathless,"I'm hunting shadows in the dark
In steaming jungles of the world
Either to kill or to be killed
By creatures never named or heard

I'm lifting wishes to the stars
The gleaming satellites of time
Orbiting circles overhead
To futures when your love is mine

But you were always pretty reckless with your love
Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone
And when you go you'll leave me breathless and alone

You leave me breathless, when you close the door
It feels just like you took the air out of the room with you

Your voice is echoing again
Through catacombs inside my mind
And I've been dreaming of revenge
To make you love me more than even you can try

All words converge to where you are
And if I follow I would surely find
The horse is gone, the fire's still warm
And you've moved on an hour before
You like to keep me just one step behind

And you were always pretty reckless with your love
Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone
And when you go you'll leave me breathless and alone

You leave me breathless, when you close the door
It feels just like you took the air out of the room with you
Breathless, breathless, breathless, breathless

Yeah, you were always pretty reckless with your love
Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone
And when you go you'll leave me breathless and alone
You leave me breathless when you close the door
It feels just like you took the air out of the room with you

Restless when it's gone, breathless and alone
You leave me breathless, when you close the door
It feels just like you took the air out of the room with you
Breathless, breathless, breathless, breathless"

It's way beyond the strip, a place they call your soul
We'll sit down for a while and let the evening roll
Don't worry about the time, we'll find a place to stay
The people 'round here seem familiar in some way
Look kind of like we did before we got so cold

In the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life

Let's fall in love again with music as our guide
We'll raise our ready hands and let go for the ride
Down into unknown lands where lovers need'nt hide
We got these lives for free, don't know where they've been
Don't know where they'll go when we are through with them
Starlight of the sun, dark side of the moon

In the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life

It seems so long ago, those empty afternoon
With nowhere much to go and nothing much to do
Just sit up in my room and let the world unfold

In the air the questions hang
Will we get to do something?
Who we gonna end up being?
How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?

Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning, at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night, when I cleaned the house
I found the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor, at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning, in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window

All the glory when He took our place
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
And He takes and He takes and He takes"

That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time

Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

Hold me fast, Hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
Hold me fast, Hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer

I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

Hold me fast, Hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
Hold me fast, Hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under"
1274,1274,Mumford & Sons,Ditmas,"And in time
As one reminds the other of the past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?

A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time

And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one

Careful hands
And wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
And now I'm losing you"

They have stolen from us

And I think that you and the freezer need to have a date
We'll add a little ice, you'll be so nice

Oh I know whenever you're in town you cause a stir
You make life sweeter than what I deserve
Casting the winter goodbye
With a glass full of summertime

We're good together lemonade
Come sit beside me while I'm rocking in the shade
We'll take a summer stroll you're SPF upon my soul now Lemonade

When the leader of the bad guys sang,
Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must've forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,

Hell's hot for good reason, so please, take me.

Three lights are lit but the fourth one's out,
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,
I forgot about the drought of lightbulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,

But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I'm thinking, ""wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house.""

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,

We haven't talked in quite some time
I know
I haven't been the best
Of sons
Hello
I've been traveling in
The desert of my mind
And I
Haven't found a drop
Of life
I haven't found a drop
Of you
I haven't found a drop
Of water

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water
In the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have
It's all that I need and
The waves of the water
Mean nothing to me
But I try my best
And all that I can to
Hold tightly onto
What's left in my hand
But no matter how
How tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down
And the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic
In fact,
I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and fourth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow
But it's the end of today
End of my ways
As a walking denial
My trail was filed as a crazy
Suicidal head case
But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming
Father
And I'm lying here just crying
So wash me with your water

Hello
We haven't talked in quite some time
I know
I haven't been the best"

You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I I never understood what was at stake
Never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want a trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed

I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

Oh, that the heart may be the weakest part of me
Oh, and the moon controls the movements of the tide
Oh, but it has no weight on the movements of my mind

But if you turn your hands to flames
Oh the light will burn the same
Whether you just pass it through
Or if it's what you meant to do

And your sense of culpability
Is from the guides that you perceived
Their constant lie that you believe
Will show you grace
Oh, when you turn to a ghost

Oh, but now the love you found
Is raising you from muddy ground
And oh, the death will let you down
'Cause your curse will still go on the same"

It's getting dark and it's getting cold and the nights are getting long
And I don't know if you even notice at all
That I'm long gone

And the things that keep us apart
Keep me alive
And the things that keep me alive
Keep me alone
This is the thing

I don't know if you notice anything missing
Like the leaves on the trees or my clothes all over the floor
And I don't know if you even notice at all
'Cause I was real quiet when I closed the door

And the things that keep us apart
Keep me alive
And the things that keep me alive
Keep me alone

1305,1305,Bon Iver,Skinny Love,"Come on skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different ""kind""
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love, what happened here
Suckled on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted?
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?"
1308,1308,Ed Sheeran,Tenerife Sea,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love

All pass the man so fast,

Ignoring the cast,
I found fifty heavy currency,
And drop it in his tin,
He said: ""When you're adventurous,
Your next one will begin"".

1311,1311,Dispatch,The General,"There was a decorated General with a heart of gold
That likened him to all the stories he told
Of past battles won and lost
And legends of old
A seasoned veteran in his own time

On the battlefield he gained respectful fame
With many medals of bravery and stripes to his name
He grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face
And always urged his men on

But on the eve of a great battle with the infantry in dream
The Old General tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning
He awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
And walked slowly out of his tent

All the men held tall with their chests in the air
With the courage in their blood and a fire in their stare
And it was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fare
Till the old general told them to go home

He said, ""I have seen the others
And I have discovered
That this fight is not worth fighting
And I've seen their mothers
And I will no other to follow me where I'm going
So

Take a shower and shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men you must be living
Take a shower and shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men you must be living
Go now you are forgiven""

But the men stood fast with their guns on their shoulders
Not knowing what to do with the contradicting orders
The General said he would do his own duty but he would extend it no further
The men can go as they pleased

But not a man moved their eyes gazed straight ahead
Till one by one they stepped back and not a word was said
And the old general was left with his own words echoing in his head
He then prepared to fight

He said, ""I have seen the others
And I have discovered
That this fight is not worth fighting
No, And I've seen their mothers
And I will no other to follow me where I'm going
So take a shower and shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men you must be living

Take a shower and shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men you must be living
Go now you are forgiven""

Go now you are forgiven
Go now you are forgiven
Go now you are forgiven, go

Go now you are forgiven
Go now you are forgiven
Go now you are forgiven
Go ooh ooh

Go now you are forgiven
Go now you are forgiven
Go now you got to be,
Got to be, got to be, got to be,
Got to be yeaaaaa"
1312,1312,Matthew West,My Own Little World,"In my own little world it hardly ever rains
I never gone hungry, always felt safe
I got some money in my pocket, shoes on my feet
In my own little world
Population: Me

I try to stay awake during Sunday morning church
I throw a twenty in the plate but I never give till it hurts
And I turn off the news when I don't like what I see
Yeah it's easy to do when it's
Population: Me

What if there's a bigger picture?
What if I'm missing out?
What if there's a greater purpose
I could be living right now
Outside my own little world

Stopped at a red light, looked out my window
I saw a cardboard sign, said ""Help this homeless widow""
And just above that sign was the face of a human
I thought to myself, ""God, what have I been doing?""
So I rolled down the window and I looked her in the eye
How many times have I just passed her by?
I gave her some money then I drove on through
In my own little world reached
Population: Two

What if there's a bigger picture?
What if I'm missing out?
What if there's a greater purpose
I should be living right now
Outside my own little world
My own little world

Father break my heart for what breaks yours
Give me open hands and open doors
And put your light in my eyes and let me see
That my own little world is not about me

What if there's a bigger picture?
What if I'm missing out?
What if there's a greater purpose
That I could be living right now
I don't wanna miss what matters
I wanna be reaching out
Show me the greater purpose
So I can start living right now
Outside my own little world
My own little world

1313,1313,Dispatch,Bang Bang,"She woke me up with a bang bang
Lookin' over crossed eyed
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the wayside
Lookin' for the high tide
What will I find
Will I find
Will I find find
All I saw was a man that had a hat that had a pompom
He's been there for years
Can someone tell me how long?

Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not

You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
And I didn't know it then but she put a spell on me
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
And meet an old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my blind side
To find an old man with a lime and a kind eye
Said ""Mister, mister, with your beard so long
Won't you be a saint and tell me just where I'm goin'""
He pointed to a conch shell and then to the lime
And said, ""This is all I really need to get by""

Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not

Hey (hey) mister man
I know ya don't know who ya, think I think I am
But I can safely say
That I shoulda been sleepin', been sleepin', been sleepin'
The day away
Hey Hey

I said excuse me
Have you got the time?
He shrugged his shoulders, said ""Get a spine""
Coconut hit me on the head jonesin' for a fig
""I got booked last night... I need another fix, dig?""

Yeah
Just then I see a twinkle twinkle in the old man's eye
And a wave tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
I caught it on the rebound and landed with a soft sound
I took out the message and put the bottle down
Inside was an antidote to the spell
And I read it to the man 'cause he couldn't read so well
Said don't worry about a thing ya know your path is true
Just ease your mind have a banana or two
Well goodness, goodness woe is me
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
But just before we left and started kickin' it
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach with a
Tune on my lips and my quest in reach
That woman come to see you with her song so sweet
Say ""Damn"" and let the poor sucker sleep... let him sleep

Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find"

Go count the cost, before you go
To the Holland road with your heart like a stone
You spared no time in lashing out
And I knew your pain and the effect of my shame
But you cut me down, You cut me down

And I will not tell the thoughts of hell
That carried me home from the Holland road
With my heart like a stone I put up no fight
To your calloused mind and from your corner you rose
To cut me down, You cut me down

So I hit my low
Little did I know that would not be the end
From the Holland road well I rose and I rose
And I paid less time to your calloused mind
And I wished you well as you cut me down, you cut me down

But I still believe, though there's cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees, I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you'll believe in me, I'll still believe

I'll sing of some desperate deeds that he did
'Way out in New Mexico long long ago
When a man's only chance was his own forty-four.
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
'Way out in the West with a gun in his hand
At the age of twelve years he did kill his first man.

There's Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy, their boy bandit king
'Ere his young manhood has reached his sad end
With a notch an his pistol for twenty one men!
Was on a sad night when poor Billy died
He said to his friend, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men I have put bullets through
Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty two!""

I'll sing you how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shinin', the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The young outlaw's life is now come to an end.
There's many a man with a face fine and fair
Who start out in life with a chance to be square
Just like poor Billy they wander astray
They'll lose their lives in the very same way!"

And it's been that way since 1994
Does his business on a flip phone with the most obnoxious ringtone
I didn't ask but I can tell he's from New York
And he spoke proudly of his daughter and that this fall she'd be in college 
And that he always wished he'd gotten his degree
You can tell he came from nothing, built a future out of hustling
And somehow I'm the one you people pay to see

Oh isn't that just the way it goes
You're dealt a good hand and you get celebrated
Oh how am I the only one who knows 
I'm half the man of the men who drive me places

Danny showed up early fifteen minutes till five thirty
Making sure that I'd be on my morning flight
He said he'd love to fix computers, but that he can't until he's fluent
So he spends his driving money taking class at night
He wore a neatly ironed dress shirt and he helps his kids with homework
And deep inside I couldn't help but ask myself
Why that at night I'm up on stage, everybody knows my name
While Danny's early picking up somebody else

Oh isn't that just the way it goes
You're dealt a good hand and you get celebrated
Oh how am I the only one who knows 
I'm half the man of the men that drive me places

And now everything's not given, I work hard to make my living
But I'll give credit where I think credits due
Maybe you got dealt a good hand
Maybe you play it the best that you can
But I don't know how far you'd walk without those cards
In Howard and Danny's working shoes

But that's just the way it goes
You're dealt a good hand and you get celebrated
Oh how am I the only one who knows

Yours is the first face that I saw
Think I was blind before I met you
Now I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange you said everything changed
You felt as if you had just woke up
And you said
This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy

So if you want to be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see

Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides maybe this time is different
I mean I really think you like me"

Breaks all the rules
It's doing it wrong, but it's moving along
Can be very cruel

Right in the door, I'm tired, I'm sore
Nary a ""Hi"", no welcome home
Yet the minute I'm up, it's pissing me off
I was yelling so loud last night
I thought the cops would surely come

Six or six-two-five, keep me alive, keep me alive
Now do a little turn, careful with your words
Everything is fine
But I'm lucky as fuck, still ain't enough, sick to my gut
Having to say
You sit here till the coast is clear
I'll send for you one day

I shouldn't repeat it, this sounds ridiculous
And I swore a solemn oath
Never to admit it's the harsh tones of criticism
Seep in to my bones

Now look what I did, I'm happy with it
Aren't you happy for me?
I love you so much, I'm gonna throw up
Watch my stuff, hold this for me please

I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

1342,1342,Kodaline,All I Want,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

Ooh

If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
All I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh"
1343,1343,Ben Howard,She Treats Me Well,"Seen fortune in my lifetime
Gave it all to the man instead
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home
She told me that
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well it seems times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

She's all right when everyone is wrong
She's all right, let's me waste another song
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

Mourning, I've done my time here
Stood here watching my own death
Well a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Slumber, not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

She's all right when everyone is wrong
She's all right, let's me waste another song
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well"
1344,1344,Tom Odell,Another Love,"I want to take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils, on a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I want to kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I want to cry and I want to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love another love
All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart
And I want to cry, I want to learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang them all to another heart
And I want to cry, I want to fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up"
1345,1345,Johnny Cash,The Man Comes Around,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see""
And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

'Til Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked and behold, a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him"
1346,1346,Lee Brice,A Woman Like You,"Last night, outta the blue
Driftin' off to the evening news
She said ""Honey, what would you do
If you'd never met me?""

I just laughed, said ""I don't know,
But I could take a couple guesses though""
And then tried to dig real deep,
Said, ""Darling honestly...

I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
I'd probably eat more drive-through chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd have never known your name
I'd still be driving that old green 'Nova

I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,
I wouldn't trade a single day
For a hundred years the other way.""

She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
'Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, ""C'mon on girl, seriously
If I hadn't been so lucky

I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
Play poker every Tuesday night, yeah
I'd have a dirt bike in the shed

And not one throw pillow on the bed
I'd keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""

She knows what a mess I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure, I whispered in her ear
""You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
And you make the best fried chicken

I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green 'Nova
But I love watchin' you do yoga

I'd take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly I don't know what I'd do
If I'd never met a woman like you."""
1347,1347,Sundy Best,Painted Blue,"When your name rolls off my tongue
I start to lose control
The sweetest sound I've ever heard
The sweetest song I've ever known

I get lost in your whispers
As you crawl across my bed
All my 25 Decembers
More I love you's ain't be said

I'm like a preacher when he prays
I'm on my knees to leave you name
But it's painted blue right on my front door
I've been broke down and I've been used/fooled
By time and age and some by you
So I just lay hear with a bottle on a floor
So when the pain starts to creep in
I just pour another shot again
So I don't have to miss you anymore

While this poison seeps in
My mind just runs in place
I've been hanging by a close pin
Time stands still on my clocks face

My voice has had too many cigarettes
And too much alcohol
I'll be damned if I don't leave all this mess
I'll get away, if I have to crawl

You're still the dream that I remember
You still have god on your side
My love is still a burning ember
Too bad you traded, your love for your pride"
1349,1349,NEEDTOBREATHE,NO EXCUSES,"I've got this feeling in my bones
That you find a solace in shadows
I don't wanna find out you're going 'round my back
Why you wanna bring me these sorrows

'Cause there's no excuses for what you're doing
There's no excuses for what you're doing

Girl, I've been your lover since high school
Everything I did, I did for you
If you're gonna tighten this rope around my neck
Girl, you better know I'm gonna fight it

'Cause there's no excuses for what you're doing
There's no excuses for what you're doing

'Cause there's no excuses for what you're doing
There's no excuses for what you're doing"
1350,1350,John Paul White,What's So,"Hole in the road
Sun on your back
Shoulder the load
Your ancestors passed
Wear on your sleeve
The virtues you lack

But don't get above your raising
Sell your damn soul
Or get right with the man
Keep treading water as long as you can
But whatever you do
You must understand

That you don't get above your raising
No you don't get above your raising

'Cause it's one for the somber
And two for the stone
And three for the ready to get low low low low
Four for the fortunate few that don't know

The difference between what should be
And what's so

Reach for the sky
Kneel down and pray
Get in the dirt and
Get out of the way
But don't you forget
Till you climb in that grave
That you don't get above your raising

One for the somber
Two for the stone
Three for the ready to get low low low low
Four for the fortunate few that don't know

The difference between what should be
And what's so

One for the somber
Two for the stone
Three for the ready to get low low low low
Four for the fortunate
Few that don't know

The difference between what should be
And what's so"
1351,1351,Chris Stapleton,Broken Halos,"Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine"
1352,1352,Chris Stapleton,"Last Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning","Postman delivered
""Past due"" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
This morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee

Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, ""It don't matter
'Cause it's the holiday season.""
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete

Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for living
And being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me"
1353,1353,Elvis Presley;Michael BublÃ©,Fever,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night.

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'

Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
Oh me giva' ya' fever
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn"
1354,1354,Marty Robbins,The Master's Call,"When I was but a young man I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad.

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master call.

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
But a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout.

Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
And this time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name.

So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground.

I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow.

My wicked past unfolded, I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life is his to take or give.

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground.

A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Saviour called my name..."
1355,1355,Josh Garrels,Farther Along,"Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
So cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
We'll understand this, all by and by

Tempted and tried, I wondered why
The good man dies, the bad man thrives
And Jesus cries because he loves em' both
We're all cast-aways in need of rope
Hangin' on by the last threads of our hope
In a house of mirrors full of smoke
Confusing illusions I've seen

Where did I go wrong, I sang along
To every chorus of the song
That the devil wrote like a piper at the gate
Leading mice and men down to their fate
But some will courageously escape
The seductive voice with a heart of faith
While walkin' the line back home

There's much more to life than we've been told
It's full of beauty that will unfold
And shine like you struck gold my wayward son
That deadweight burden weighs a ton
Go down to the river and let it run
And wash away all the things you've done
Forgiveness, all right

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
So cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
We'll understand this, all by and by

But still I get hard pressed on every side
Between the rock and a compromise
Like truth and a pack of lies fightin' for my soul
And I've got no place left go
'Cause I got changed by what I've been shown
There's more glory than the world has known
Keeps me ramblin' on

Skipping like a calf loosed from its stall
I'm free to love once and for all
And even when I fall I'll get back up
For the joy that overflows my cup
Heaven filled me with more than enough
Broke down my levees and my bluffs
Let the flood wash me

And one day when the sky rolls back on us
Some rejoice and the others fuss
Cause every knee must bow and tongue confess
The son of god is forever blessed
His is the kingdom, and we're the guests
So put your voice up to the test
Sing Lord, come soon

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
So cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
We'll understand this, all by and by"

All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
And gonna give it to the people, then they'll see
Then they'll see

Spinning the tops, as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
Covered my tracks, thought I was fine
Got no self control now I'm back here in line

All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
And gonna give it to the people, then they'll see
Then they'll see, oh

Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Mmm, mmm, I don't know

He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life

Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

1369,1369,The Fray,Never Say Never,"Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without, just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Picture: you're the queen of everything
As far as the eye can see, under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time, time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

We're coming apart but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again

1370,1370,Jason Mraz,I'm Yours,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"
1371,1371,Edwin McCain,I'll Be,"The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
And emeralds from mountains, the thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth
And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed
And you're my survival, you're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead

And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Well I've dropped out
I've burned up
I've fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in
Turned on
Remembered the things that you said

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

The greatest fan of your life"

1374,1374,Coldplay,Fix You,"When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day

You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know

I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?

1377,1377,Kelly Clarkson,Because of You,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"

Runnin' out of credit and find a little cash on the radio
Standin' still they're blowin' past, numbers on cars goin' NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know

'Cause where I come from only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

Meanwhile back at Mama's, the porch light's on, come in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge, red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge,
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes, whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss, in a world gone crazy as this

Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here ---

'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's, the porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge, red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes, whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss, in a world gone crazy as this

Oh, I miss yeah a little dirt on the road I miss corn growin' in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town roots, walkin' around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof, it's time we head on back ---

'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's the for sale sign's goin' up
And I'm gonna dump this truck and the little I got on a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge, goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin' on the ridge, baby, tell me what you think about this ---

Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah, me and you back at Mama's"
1379,1379,Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"

For a thousand years

Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh, baby, I need you now"
1387,1387,The Band Perry,If I Die Young,"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh, oh oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when your really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls"
1388,1388,Bruno Mars,Just The Way You Are,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah"
1389,1389,Heartland,I Loved Her First,"Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each others face
So much in love your alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one
She told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything
Life must go on
And I'm not gonna stand in your way

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it still hard to give her away
I loved her first

How could that beautiful women with you
Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But its still hard to give her away
I loved her first

From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
Someday you might know what I'm going through
When a miracle smiles up at you
I loved her first"
1390,1390,Chris Young,Who I Am With You,"I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found but

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high,
You make me want to hold on tight, 'cause

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

Who I am with you
Because of you I'm a lucky man
You're the best part of who I am

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

Yes, who I am with you"
1391,1391,Train,Drops of Jupiter,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?"
1392,1392,Van Morrison,Into The Mystic,"We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won
As we sailed into the mystic

Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
Into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows, I will be coming home
And when the fog horn blows, I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will fold
Into the mystic

When that fog horn blows, you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows, I gotta hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will fold
Into the mystic
Come on, girl

Too late to stop now"
1393,1393,Christina Aguilera,Beautiful,"Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone, left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no, no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeaheah, yeaheah!)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine!)
And tomorrow we might awake on the other side

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh no, ooh
Yeaheah
Don't you bring me down today, heyey
Don't you bring me down today"
1394,1394,Ben Rector,When A Heart Breaks,"I woke up this morning
And I heard the news
I know the pain of a heartbreak
I don't have answers
And neither do you
I know the pain of a heartbreak

This isn't easy
This isn't clear
And you don't need Jesus
Till you're here
Then confusion and the doubts you had
Up and walk away
They walk away
When a heart breaks

I heard the doctor
But what did he say
I knew I was fine about this time yesterday
I don't need answers
I just need some peace
I just need someone who could help me get some sleep
Who could help me get some sleep

This isn't easy
This isn't clear
And you don't need Jesus
Till you're here
Then confusion and the doubts you had
Up and walk away
They walk away
When a heart breaks
When a heart breaks
When a heart breaks
Oh, when a heart breaks

This isn't easy
This isn't clear
And you don't need Jesus
Till you're here
Then confusion and the doubts you had
Up and walk away
They walk away
When a heart breaks"
1395,1395,Sam Hunt,Speakers,"I softly kiss your neck, and slowly whisper
You breathe in cause it feels cold where my lips were
T-shirt for a pillow, music up real low, creeping through the window
I can feel the bass line in the bed liner, and your heart on mine
Trying to jump up out of your chest

Baby your now on fire, girl your on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind around us is breezing around us
Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head

And I'm on fire, girl your on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

I'm tuned in to you, somethings on your mind ain't it?
Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it
Your lips, your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare
Your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set
I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me going up in flames

Girl I'm on fire, girl your on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on"
1396,1396,John Mayer,Daughters,"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too"

1398,1398,Coldplay,Clocks,"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lyin'

If you really don't mean it, I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buyin'

Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you

Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?

Yeah baby, I'm begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then don't call me

I don't mind a little smoke gettin' in my eyes
Baby, take your hands, take your lies
And lay 'em on me

Well don't worry about the damage done,
Just let those words roll of your tongue
Even if you're lyin'

Say you do
Just say you do"
1400,1400,Tim McGraw,Live Like You Were Dying,"He said, ""I was in my early 40s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the X-rays
And talking 'bout the options, and talking 'bout
Sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do""
And he said

""I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

He said, ""I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well, I, I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu,
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

Like, tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what'd you do
With it
What did you do with it?
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?

Skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'

Sunday morning rain is falling 
Steal some covers, share some skin 
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable 
You twist to fit the mold that I am in 
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do 
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 

That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 

Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
Paint a picture with my hands 
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
Change the weather, still together when it ends 

That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 
Yeah!

Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinking alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doing here?""

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da

Outside and the sun was shinning.
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside.
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words,
But they were so hard to find.

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us

I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love

I kissed your tears all falling down
Said baby, you'll always be the one
Aw baby I'm never going to turn around
Your all the life I have in these lungs

We can all be scared to death
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us

I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I remember that night at your mamas house
We were so in love, finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees,
Said you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the isle,
I remember it now,
I remember your smile

I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
Yaaaaaaa
Ill bring you back to love
Ill bring you back to love"
1406,1406,Niykee Heaton,Bad Intentions,"This is the face I wear treading the riptide
Abysmal oceans where good girls go to die
I wanna love somebody
Wanna feel their love on me
But after everything I still believe in true love
Not being able to find it
Damn it tears me up
And I know it's my fault
I know it's my fault
Let's take a trip, ten thousand miles above the clouds
We can stay up here until we figure it out
I don't wanna go home
Don't wanna be alone, be alone

I've got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 
I've got some damn bad intentions
I see the world in 25 dimensions
I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood heat over tension
And I know...

You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies
You can see it in my eyes
I don't wanna die

I've just got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 
I've got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 

I know we've made a graveyard of this all
I know I don't feel too sober now
I wanna lie awake with your black soul
Count your fears if you let me

Baby I just want your damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh

I've got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learnt my lesson, woah oh"

She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only

Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late

A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find, you and I collide

I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find, you and I collide

Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find, you and I collide

You finally find 
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide"

To pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust, 
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me?

I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love

You say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me. 
Good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball 
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus 
I wish that I could be more like you.

I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,

You say that you need me,

Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances 
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted, 
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, 
Oh I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.

1411,1411,Zac Brown Band,Colder Weather,"She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights shinin' through the windowpane

He said, ""I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?""
She said, ""You're a ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'""

At a truck stop diner just outside o' Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

He said, ""I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?""
She said, ""You're a ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame

Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

Oh, I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
(I ain't ever gonna change)
I ain't ever gonna change
(Got a gypsy soul to blame)
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then"
1412,1412,Luke Bryan,Drink A Beer,"When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say.
So I just hung up the phone.
I took a walk to clear my head,
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good lord knows
The reasons why it gets
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend, until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times we used to
Sit right here on the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer, drink a beer."

Everything 
On our own

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"

We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide"

Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music
Maybe then you'll score, oh oh

Why'd you have to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh oh

Just slow down if you want me

Good vibrations through & through, oh oh

The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

If mine could be the name that changes yours,
The wine in your glass,
The swing on your porch,
The dollar in your pocket,
And the peaceful in your sleep,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

If I could be the fire in your firefly,
The cool in the rain,
The spark in your eye,
The answer to your prayer,
And the faith that sets you free,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me,
What you mean to me

And oh,
All of this talkin' makes you laugh,
But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

Yeah,

It ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

The wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The ""I love you's,"" the ""I told you so's""
Past few miles to wherever's home

Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"

When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're trying to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

Wheels up
I've got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me"
1427,1427,Gavin DeGraw,Not Over You,"Dreams, that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio

Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation
I know that much is understood

And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Not over you
Not over you
Not over you"
1429,1429,Anna Nalick,Breathe (2 AM),"2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season.""

Yeah we walk through the door so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason

'Cause you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable
And, life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button girl
So cradle your head in your hands

And breathe, just breathe
Oh-oh breathe, just breathe

May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
""Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year.""

Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while
But my God it's so beautiful, when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

'Cause you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable
And, life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button boys
So cradle your head in your hands

And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

""There's a light at each end of this tunnel!"" you shout
'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made you'll just make them again
If you only try turning around

2 AM and I'm still awake writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer
Inside of me, threatenin' the life it belongs to

And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary, screamin' out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

But you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand

And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

Oh breathe, just breathe
Oh breathe, just breathe"
1430,1430,Tracy Chapman,Fast Car,"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
Been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You see, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
Still ain't got a job
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way"
1431,1431,Lifehouse,You And Me,"What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning 
I don't know where to go from here

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive"
1432,1432,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

Love yourz
No such thing

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level 'cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons 'cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive"
1434,1434,Jason Mraz,I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"

Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel

For me
And I'm feeling
Good
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this old world, is a new world, and a bold world
For me
For me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine, and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life
Huh
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life

1436,1436,Matt Nathanson,Come On Get Higher,"I miss the sound of your voice
And I miss the rush of your skin
And I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
Make you believe
Make you forget

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet, perfect words that you said

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
Make you believe
And make you forget

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

So come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

I miss the pull of your heart
I can taste the sparks on your tongue
And I see angels and devils and God when you come on
Hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on...

Sing sha la la la
Sing sha la la la la
Hoo hoo hoo

Come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

Come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me
Drown me in love

It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all wrong, it's so right

Come on get higher
Come on and get higher
Because everything works, love
Because everything works in your arms"
1437,1437,Zac Brown Band,Free,"So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

And We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just Me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

Drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just Me and you

Lay underneath the
Harvest moon
Do all the things
That lovers do
Just me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be"
1438,1438,The Fray,Happiness,"Happiness was just outside my window
I thought it'd crash blowing 80-miles an hour
But, happiness is a little more like knocking
On your door, you just let it in

Happiness feels a lot like sorrow
Let it be, you can't make it come or go
But you are gone, not for good but for now
And gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
'Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks

Happiness damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself that's enough for now
But happiness has a violent roar

Happiness it's like the old man told me
Look for it, and you'll never find it all
But let it go, live your life and leave it
Then one day, wake up and she'll be home
Home, home, home"

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you

So hold you close
To help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love

I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I never went to bed, shit... wine or water?
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more

Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry.""

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said ""You niggas crazy.""
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble"
1447,1447,Haley Reinhart,Can't Help Falling in Love,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh, take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, oh, for I, I can't help
Falling in love with you"
1448,1448,James Bay,Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me"
1449,1449,Ellie Goulding,Your Song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"
1450,1450,Adele,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"
1451,1451,Jonas Brothers,When You Look Me in the Eyes,"If the heart is always searching,
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone,
I'll never make it on my own.
Dreams can't take the place of loving you,
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes,
And tell me that you love me.
Everything's all right,
When you're right here by my side.
When you look me in the eyes,
I catch a glimpse of heaven.
I find my paradise,
When you look me in the eyes.

How long will I be waiting,
To be with you again
Gonna tell you that I love you,
In the best way that I can.
I can't take a day without you here,
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear.

When you look me in the eyes,
And tell me that you love me.
Everything's all right,
When you're right here by my side.
When you look me in the eyes,
I catch a glimpse of heaven.
I find my paradise,
When you look me in the eyes.

More and more, I start to realize,
I can reach my tomorrow,
I can hold my head up high,
And it's all because you're by my side.

When you look me in the eyes,
And tell me that you love me.
Everything's all right,
When you're right here by my side.
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go

'Cause when you look me in the eyes.

And tell me that you love me.
Everything's all right,
When you're right here by my side.
When you look me in the eyes,
I catch a glimpse of heaven.
I find my paradise,
When you look me in the eyes."
1452,1452,Mario,Let Me Love You,"Baby I just don't get it

Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you, yeah
Listen

Your true beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts 
You're a dime plus ninety-nine
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth 

Everywhere you go they stop and stare 
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control baby you know 

If I was yo man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'll be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right

1453,1453,Zac Brown Band,Jolene,"Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Sold my coat when I hit spokane
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early
Morning rain
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine
My eyes been stung with dust and blind
Held you in my arms one time
Lost you just the same

Jolene
I ain't about to go straight
It's too late
I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair
Blood in my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene

Been so long since I seen your face
Or felt a part of this human race
I've been living out of this here suitcase for way too long
A man needs something he can hold onto
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
Either one of them things will do

Jolene
I ain't about to go straight
It's too late
I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair
Blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means

1454,1454,J. Cole,Lost Ones,"Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this gon make me think 'bout wifing you
Like if you had my first child would I spend my whole life with you

Now I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now I ain't tryna spend the night with you
I'm kinda lost see
I've been giving it some thought lately and frankly

I'm feelin' like we ain't ready and it's... hold up now
Let me finish
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gon' raise a kid by ourself?

Handle biz by ourself
A nigga barely over 20, where the hell we gon' live?
Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world

When I ain't got shit to give 'em
And I'm not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out
Girl, you gotta think 'bout how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it

She said nigga you got nerve
To come up to me talkin' bout abortion
This my body nigga so don't think you finna force shit
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals

It figures though, should've known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them draws?
Knowing all the right things to say

I let you hit it raw mothafucker
Now I'm pregnant you don't wanna get involved muthafucker
Tryna take away a life, is you God mothafucker?
I don't think so

This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife
This new life here imma love it
I'm ain't budging, I'll do this by my muthafucking self

See my momma raised me without no muthafucking help from a man
But I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back?
Bout your father and you told me that you hate nigga

Talkin' 'bout he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mamma when she had you and he ain't shit
Here you go doin' the same shit
You ain't shit nigga!

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And ain't nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it

Now, I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And ain't nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it

They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons
They grow apart she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her

Now she wide open
She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though

Uh oh, she tellin' him she missed her period like typos
He panicking, froze up like a manikin
A life grows inside her now he asking ""Is it even mine?""
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dawg?

Could she be lying?
She crying, crying 'cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas' emotions like they some action figures

Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It's like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?
(What about your seed nigga?)

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it"
1455,1455,The Fray,Look After You,"If I don't say this now I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I want to take
Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you

There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you won't you, be the one I always know
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby

I'll look after you
I'll look after you


If ever there was a doubt
My love she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
After you

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

It's always half and never whole
You've begun to feel like home
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

Be my baby

In love with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue

Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on fallin' in and out 
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

Oh, oh, I
Never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain

Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin'
Back in love with you

I keep on fallin' in and out 
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall
Fall, fall

I keep on fallin' in and out

Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place

I will never be with you"

1464,1464,Sam Hunt,Break Up In A Small Town,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sitting there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town"
1465,1465,Sam Hunt,Take Your Time,"I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you, but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say 'Hi'

And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
But don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not gonna waste it
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time

I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lies
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know your trying to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk to much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You coulda rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Coulda walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time"
1466,1466,Jhene Aiko,The Worst,"Tell me what you say now?
Tell me what you say
Come again?

If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me fazed out

And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you

Tell me what you say now
Tell me what you say?
You said that you would come again
You (said) that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Till I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep running away
(But I don't need you)

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you

But I love you

Everybody's like
He's no item
Please don't like em
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listened
No
I shoulda figured though
All that shit you was spittin'
So unoriginal
But it was you
So I was with it
Then tell you the truth
Wish we never did it

'Cause I usually do
Stick to the business
But you came out the blue
And then you just flipped it
God damn baby
My mind's blown
Be forgettin'
You live in a different time zone
Think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
Yeah I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
This is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

And though
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I still want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you"
1467,1467,Kanye West;Paul McCartney,Only One,"As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, 'cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
'Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world 'cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me..."
1469,1469,Emeli SandÃ©,My Kind of Love,"I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy so I'm not gonna lie
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

Know I'm far from perfect, nothing like your entourage
I can't grant you any wishes, I won't promise you the stars
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

'Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love

And when you're cryin' out
When you've fallen and can't pick your head up off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love

You won't see me at the parties, I guess I'm just no fun
I won't be turning up the radio singing, baby, you're the one
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

I know sometimes I get angry and I say what I don't mean
I know I keep my heart protected far away from my sleeve
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

'Cause when you've given it up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love

And when you're cryin' out
When you've fallen and can't pick your head up off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love

'Cause when you've given it up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love"
1470,1470,Adele,Chasing Pavements,"I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love

But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it?

Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?"
1471,1471,Alessia Cara,Here,"(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here (oh oh, oh oh)"
1472,1472,Frank Ocean,Novacane,"I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted
Did didn't I can't feel nothin', superhuman
Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin'
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of

Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

Sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like
Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of

Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

Novocaine for the pain

Pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity

I can't feel a thing
I can't feel her
Novocaine for the pain"
1473,1473,Snakehips;Tinashe;Chance The Rapper,All My Friends,"We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bit of brown salt, stinging on my tongue and I
I will not waver, I will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground
With the lips of another
Till you get lonely, sure I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit a Wall Street traffic took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the ZZZ's
Popping the polar opposite the NZT
Hip hop and the propaganda say they name brand
But I done seen how the xan did my main man
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone till November
On my city come December
Dreams are made for cages nigga
Lions are for real nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills nigga
Friday's awful chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

Don't even know me
Sure I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slump my head
I'm stuck here with the vultures
Hissing and circling
You didn't call me, call me, call me, call me
I'm crawling, crawling, crawling back to you

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe"

1476,1476,Drake;Jhene Aiko,From Time,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love"

Gotta do my hair, gotta put on make-up
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff

What a waste of my day
If I had it my way
I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love and then we fuck
And then you give me my space
Hey

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Let's get faded
Better call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby let's get wasted
We should just get naked

'Cause I've been working hard and I know you be on the same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just wanna ease your mind and make you feel all right
So go head tell your baby mama you gon' be with me tonight
Right

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20

Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, ha ha on the sleeve
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love when you say ""guess what?"" (what? What?)

Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Be a class act, never mind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high

That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It'll be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, one soul, two halves

No joke, who laughs?
Just us (just us, just us)

Okay, got this oj and jose
Mixed it up with that rosÃ©
We gon' do this our own way
All right, okay

What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

We should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right here
You should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right here"
1479,1479,G-Eazy,Marilyn (feat. Dominique Lejeune),"I, I, I, I, I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be all right
So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be
Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedy's
No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies
Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
Life is too short, trying to hold it all together
It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better
It's whatever, I just hope that you remember
Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as big sweater
She said, ""You're always gone.""
I said, ""'The fuck do you expect from me?""
Then she look at me and she said to me

I, I, I, I, I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything's gonna be all right
So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, maybe in some other lifetime
Or somewhere down the road we might meet up at the right time
Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes
Caught me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime
Well, maybe G is just an asshole
Fuck around with bitches alphalpha, little rascal
I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
But temptation's always pushing people to the brink
Fuck, I always lose my judgement when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out
I try to talk it out but this is all she speak about

I, I, I, I, I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything's gonna be all right
So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me
Lets let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime

Everything's gonna be all right
So baby get some sleep tonight"
1480,1480,OneRepublic,Stop And Stare,"This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're ""here"" not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run 'til you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there

Waitin' on that sun to go down

Slide over, well slip out to the outskirts of town
Got a blanket and a fifth of comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It's supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight... yeah

'Bout a mile off old mill road
In that spot nobody knows
Park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Yeah I hope it's gonna be a long one
If were lucky its moving slow
Wouldn't mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside lets go

'Bout a mile off old mill road
In that spot nobody knows
Park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up girl, I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old box cars

Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Let's go listen to the night train

1483,1483,Thomas Rhett,Die A Happy Man,"Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby

Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint; you're a goddess; the cutest; the hottest; a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

Well, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Baby, I could die a happy man
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man"
1484,1484,Jana Kramer,I Got The Boy,"I saw your picture in a paper, Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ball cap in a pick up, seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, she got the man

Yeah there's an old you that I knew,
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Back woods on a four wheel, hanging on tight, I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future and I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy and she got the man

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy and she got the man"

Last night I sent a message
Drunk when I sent it, pieces of a fragments a sentence
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And cross the line just saying if you're down
Let's chill and get a drink
I sip, hoping I would hear again
The text bubble popped up and disappeared again
Like I don't want it getting weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
Sometimes I wonder if you share my sentiments maybe
Let me know

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you oh oh
'Cause I do boy

Staring at the ceiling makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall

All night
Hearing voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold back

And I don't know why

Talking to myself in public
And dodging glances on the train

And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

You don't know how lovely you are

Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

But I'm holding you closer than most,
'Cause you are my heaven.

I don't wanna waste the weekend,
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
And as my train rolls down the East coast,
I wonder how you keep warm.
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Still I can't let you be,
Most nights I hardly sleep.
Don't take what you don't need, from me.

Misplaced trust and old friends,
Never counting regrets,
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
And New England as the leaves change;
The last excuse that I'll claim,
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Still I can't let you be,

You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing

I think of you and everything's okay

If it does not exist, but darling

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh

Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own, every sky was
Your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love to light the shadows on your face.
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all,
Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.

And maybe, I'll find out a way to make it back, someday.
To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days.
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all,
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you.

If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will...

No! Run away with my heart.
Run away with my hope.
Run away with my love.

I know now, just quite how,
My life and love might still go on.
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time.

If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.

If I could turn back time,
I'll go wherever you will go.
If I could make you mine,
I'll go wherever you will go.
I'll go wherever you will go."

I'll get out of California
I'm tired of the weather
Think I'll get a lover
And fly him out to Spain
I think I'll go to Boston
I think that I'm just tired
I think I need a new town
To leave this all behind
I think I need a sunrise
I'm tired of the sunset

Some snow would be nice

Let you in but let you go?

1508,1508,Tim McGraw,Humble And Kind,"You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget, the key's under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind

Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door; say 'please'; say 'thank you'
Don't steal, don't cheat and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb, but
Always stay humble and kind

When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride, but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no-one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind

Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
'I love you' ain't no pick up line, so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door; say 'please'; say 'thank you'
Don't steal, don't cheat and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb, but
Always stay humble and kind

When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride, but
Always stay humble and kind

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind

Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin'
Don't forget, turn back 'round
Help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind"
1509,1509,Sam Hunt,Make You Miss Me,"You hear a new song, it's your favorite
Pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too
Heavy into everything
Ready for the next thing
Catch a ride for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shines gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

Whoa whoa
I ain't gunna be that easy to leave
Whoa whoa
Girl I'm gunna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gunna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was to easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Whoa whoa
I ain't gunna be that easy to leave
Whoa whoa
Girl I'm gunna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
I'm gunna make you miss me

Whoa whoa
I ain't gunna be that easy to leave
Whoa whoa
Girl I'm gunna make you miss me

Writing letters that you're never gunna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gunna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me
Wanna make you miss me
Gunna make you miss me
And oh oh oh
I'm gunna make you miss me"
1510,1510,Kane Brown,Used to Love You Sober,"Life was great
Wouldn't change a thing
I had it all but with you I had more
But out of nowhere out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling

Now the only way I know how to get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, I'd leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

I'm on the floor cursing at the door
Broken-hearted with a pounding head
And I know I got to let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase

Now the only way I know how to get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, I'd leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

Now you're gone, You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling
Now the only way I know how to get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, I'd leave it all behind

I used to love you sober"
1511,1511,Adele,When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move

Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old

It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old

It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"

Hit the house lick, tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big balling with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter

Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spillin', pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter and 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands, just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways

Just bring my car back
Shit, he faded, he feeling good
Look, listen to him

Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Walking like a one-man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You better know that in the end 
It's better to say too much 
Than never to say what you need to say

Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say"
1515,1515,Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside"

Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sheryl Crow:
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

Sheryl Crow:
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
Kid Rock:
It was the same ole same ""how have you been?""
Both:
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

Kid Rock:
You reminded me of brighter days
Sheryl Crow:
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
Kid Rock:
I was off to drink you away

Both:
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I just called to say I love you
Come back home"
1523,1523,The Calling,Wherever You Will Go,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there, oh
Who can bring me back to you

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go

I'll go wherever you will go"

Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes

And we could pretend it all the time

Ringing it's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to we got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of you're arms
Don't really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow, mmm mmm, wake up slow

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most till someone said to me

Aw man (Sherane)
Where is she taking me?
Where is she taking me?

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
(That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin')
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in 's lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
(And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too)
Wait hold up, ay I see somebody

Aha, got them niggas, K-dot, you good?

And I'll say...

Till I get to the end of this tunnel... mummy
If you could keep me floating just for a while
I'll get back to you

Take a Jimi Thing
Just to keep me swingin'

I shouldn't care if you don't like it
Brother chaos rules all about
Sometimes I walk there
Sometimes, God knows, I take a bus there
I should't care I shouldn't care bereaved as
I'm feeling

Day is gone I'm on my back
Staring up at the ceiling
I take a drink sit back relax
Smoke my mind makes me feel
Better for a small time
What I want is what I've not got
What I need is all around me

And slip into my lover's hands
Kiss me, won't you kiss me now?
And sleep I would inside your mouth

Don't be us too shy
For knowing it's no big surprise that
I will wait for you
I will wait for no one but you

Oh, please, lover lay down
Spend this time with me
Together share this smile
Lover lay down
Spend this time with me
Walk with me, walk with you

Hold my hand your hands
So much we have dreamed
And we were so much younger
Hard to explain that we are stronger

A million reasons, life to deny
Let's toss them away
See you and me, we
Lay down, look see
She and he
By my lover's side
Together share this smile
Each other's tears to cry
Together share this smile
Lover lay down

Oh, please
Oh, please, lover lay down
Oh, please, lover lay down
And you weep
Lover lay down
'Cause it's over

Could I love you, could you love me?
Could I love you, could you love me?
Could I love you, could you love me?

There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between"

Slips away
Looking at the cracks creeping across my face
I remember the little kid living in here
He'll be living here probably until I'm dead

Please don't leave me, baby
Please don't leave me yet

Sitting in a box away from the world out there
A world piled high with boxes just like this
Please don't ever leave me alone in here
Take me out and shake off the dust, shake off the fear

Please don't leave me, baby
Please don't leave me yet

If you stay with me
That don't mean we have to stay the same
If you stay with me
Baby, you and me could change the game

I don't know the man that's living in my head
Till you reached down and brought the light back in
No, I don't know the man living in my head
If I don't know the woman sleeping in my bed

Remember how we used to kiss, baby
Kiss like it was everything
Remember how we used to love, baby
Love like it was everything

You stay with me
That don't mean we have to stay the same
You stay with me
Baby, you and me we'll change the game
You stay with me
I will follow you and start again
Baby

I only got a minute or two to spare
And I got a whole damn life to fit in there
So why waste time staring at the TV set?
Like I got dreams to kill
And people to forget

Remember how we used to dance?
Just like it was everything

You stay with me
That don't mean we have to stay the same
You stay with me
Baby, you and me could make a change
You stay with me
But that don't mean I wanna stay the same

Shit just got real, things are getting intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me
Telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking
Like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

Would ever come my way

You kept what was worth keeping around

There are reasons why I am this way

You have a hold of it now
I need you to breathe new life into me
You have a hold of it now

I tried to loosen off your hold
But you stayed and nothing made you fall
I knew when you took me over
That you where not like the others
I can be young and reckless
But you stayed

I have opened that heart so many times

When I woke, I was not awake
Light from the sun felt so far away
I went up, with all of my strength
Straight for the sun, from the depths I sprang
And I drank from the sea
But it opened up and swallowed me
So I sank down deep
No I'm drunken like a seasick dream
In this dream, I am awake

I am awake

Well when did all of the waves
Roll right in and make me their slave
So I went far away
I didn't look back, I'll come back someday
Mamma wept, and she weeped
She said horizon don't you take him from me
Black sails on the sea
Just carry me until I can be
Awake, in this dream

I am awake"

I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing
But I can try for your heart

Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia-tone loving
Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions of my heart
Like why we're here? 'nd where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy,
No, Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

Mmm it's always better when we're together
Yeah we look at them stars when we're together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
And brings new things
But tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, It's always better when we're together
Mmm We're somewhere in between together
Well It's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up
You look so pretty sleeping next to me

And there is no combination of words I could say

Oh the reason I hold on
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Rihanna:
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move

Rihanna and Mikky Ekko:
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way

Rihanna:
I want you to stay, stay

Rihanna and Mikky Ekko:
I want you to stay, oh"

To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Ooh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body

I get it
Yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me

Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me

Aw please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know"

I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my play of ways got way to complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go, they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say that way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

Break it down, yeah
Yes sir, check

We use to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just levelled up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man it's true, ex's change, yeah
Guess you changed for the better (better)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

For real shawty
Yeah I know

Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
I'ma fuck you over, wanna fuck you over then again the truth
'Cause I ain't really here to start problems
Girl I swear to God though, hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em ""Don't try him""
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise him
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and fourth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass on my grip, college
Make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say wassup witchu? You got my soul"

Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

And now I'm missin' your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

I blame it on the distance
Why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, that fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart won't
Just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart

To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real

Cleansed from the demons

And my bitch called talkin' bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check"
1559,1559,Bon Iver,Re: Stacks,"This my excavation
And today is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain, this is paralyzed

I keep throwing it down two-
Hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell

On your back with your racks and the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks of the stacks are your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Well I've been twisting to the sun
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me;
His wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

This is not the sound of a new man
Or a crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be safe with me"

You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

Rolling with your party

We can have a party, just listening to music

Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party

It's easy to give in to your heart
When you're drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' 'cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were...

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said ""Do you think we'll live forever?"" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were...

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes

Know what I need, yeah

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
'Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

I need some real good lovin'

I need some real good lovin'

Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind

Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game

Baby I'm thinking it over
What if the way we started made it something cursed from the start
What if it only gets colder
Would you still wrap me up and tell me that you think this was smart
Cause lately I've been scared of even thinking 'bout where we are

Yeah. Man, this is the softest thing I ever did
But... it's about something pretty important to me...

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

Fuck it, I don't even know what I could have done
Looking back thinking ""That's what I should have done""
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on
Running the rap game, with that lane
Always got to be up on that train, or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name
But that blame on me
Chasing something, feeling dumb 'cause you all I need
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be
And I'm sorry

It's the hardest rule to follow (I'm thinking of you)

When I'm being dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face?
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh
You know the past was a blast but it never could last
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call
Whenever something going on I be pressing ""Moll""
Up in the phone till I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex
And you'll forget, but it's best
You the best to me girl, always bake me something
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
'Cause even when I can't say ""Love you""
I love you

Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?

Yeah, today"
1575,1575,Coldplay,Everglow,"Oh they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on, how come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
Oh when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd be friends till we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling this everglow

Oh- I I I I
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh the light that you left me will everglow"

The sun on snow
Rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over
A parting of ways
And it's done
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
Could have been lost
Would have been saved
Oh ah, ooh ooh ooh
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping its spin
But come on don't give up don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Ah didn't we have fun?

I know it's over
Before she says
""Know someone else has taken your place""
""I know it's over""

The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight till it's over
Fight till it's done

Didn't we have fun?
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost,
We would have been saved
Oh ah ah ah ah
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Ah ah
Didn't we have fun?

Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to

You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be

Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?

Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'

If I pass out drunk and you check my message
And see my exes
Would you still believe that it's only just us
And I'm not reckless?
Would you know if I ever laid with another lover?
We was on a break, babe and I wore a rubber
Would you forgive me?

Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'?

Dark brown eyes
Daddy told her all she knows
She brought me to life
She set my soul in motion
And there's only one thing I gotta know

Warmed your heart for me

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side

Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter

So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna feel so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming, hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart, art, art, art
It's California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me

And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

1594,1594,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1595,1595,Niykee Heaton;Migos;OG Parker,Bad Intentions,"This is the face I wear treading the riptide
Abysmal oceans where good girls go to die
I wanna love somebody
Wanna feel their love on me
But after everything I still believe in true love
Not being able to find it
Damn it tears me up
And I know it's my fault
I know it's my fault
Let's take a trip, ten thousand miles above the clouds
We can stay up here until we figure it out
I don't wanna go home
Don't wanna be alone, be alone

I've got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 
I've got some damn bad intentions
I see the world in 25 dimensions
I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood heat over tension
And I know...

You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies
You can see it in my eyes
I don't wanna die

I've just got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 
I've got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh 

I know we've made a graveyard of this all
I know I don't feel too sober now
I wanna lie awake with your black soul
Count your fears if you let me

Baby I just want your damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah oh

I've got some damn bad intentions
I've got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learnt my lesson, woah oh"

But hold up wait, new position

Gridlocked on the dusty avenues
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more than innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways that you don't know

Don't complicate it
Don't let the past dictate
I have been patient
But slowly 
I'm losing faith

So please
I know you baby
I know you baby
So please
I know you baby

I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on a road to misery
And what I gave to you, I can never get back

Don't complicate it
Don't drive yourself insane
Say what you will but
I know that you want to stay

So please
I know you baby
I know you baby
So please
I know you baby

Chemicals rushing in
I know that it's you that I belong to (I belong to)

Why does it gotta be so heavy
Baby it's the little things
Maybe we can change the world
One heart at a time

You can't say you love too much
You can't say you care enough
There's no such thing as reaching to far
We've all got a heart
And you can't say love too much
You can't say love too much

As simple as I word you say
You never know the lives you can change
Never know the souls you can save
And I bet it happens everyday
'Cause everybody's got a story, a past, or a song of glory
Just take a look around
Somebody needs you now
You're somebody's hero somehow

You can't say you love too much
You can't say you care enough
There's no such thing as reaching to far
We've all got a heart
No you can't say love too much
And no you can't say love too much

Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
And bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop I lost a friend
My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain

Saying slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world"

And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet,
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same.
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
(Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Gotta love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

And when the pastor rises the pews
From reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see"

Like only we can
Love on the weekend

You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another seratonin overflow

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it

Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing

Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don't got one
So we'll build one of our own

Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I'm gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can't change my ways

I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing

Time's been talikn' to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying ""Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart""
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep on changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep...

I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

Changing

You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart
Tell me why are you still so afraid?

Where's the fire? What's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day, hey

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight

Too bad, but it's the life you lead 
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're right

You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, ooh 
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
Why don't you realize Vienna waits for you?
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?"

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(A jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
1615,1615,James Arthur,Can I Be Him,"You walked into the room
And now my heart has been stolen
You took me back in time to when I was unbroken
Now you're all I want
And I knew it from the very first moment
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him

I heard there was somone but I know he don't deserve you
If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you
I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips
It's all that I've been thinking about
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories

Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Oh, can I, can I be him

Want you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him
Want you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him

I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me

Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong

And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

And don't tell me you need me

I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?

I could fall, or I could fly

Every mess that I made

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

Saw you walk inside a bar

I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey yeah, hey yeah)

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)

But I guess you look happier, you do

I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car

Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here"

I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I've been thrown out, I've been burned
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name

You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive

Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls""
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

John Legend:
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

Kanye West:
""Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"" - Chloe Mitchell

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

Chris Rock:
Oh my God
Baby you done took this shit to another mother fucking level
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, goddamn
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how'd, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh, shit, I never been here before""
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him
I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'mma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga, oh
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
Even with the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in the Source
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in the Source
That's right, that's right, yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well"

Little boys and little girls handed the brand new families
There comes a time in life
When we finally get to choose
And I choose you, I choose you

We can't give our two cents
Of how tall we want to be
We don't get an opinion
On our ethnicity
But the one we spend our life with
That we get to choose
And I choose, I choose you

I choose you, to be by my side
I choose you, to hold me at night
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right
I choose you, I choose you

Everybody has one,
A choice they get to make
Half human half heaven
That decides the family tree
Now we all pick the branches
That then becomes the roots
I choose you, I choose you

I choose you, to be by my side
I choose you, to hold me at night
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right
I choose you, I choose you

I was worried I would not know what to do
If I was in these shoes
Standing here it's clearer than the sky is blue
That I choose you, I choose you
With so little we control, thank God it's in the rules
We get to choose, and I choose you

I choose you, to be by my side
I choose you, to hold me at night
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right
I choose you, I choose you"

Covered in scars and I can't help showin'

1639,1639,Taylor Swift,Fifteen,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted, was to be wanted
Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen

La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la-la-la la la la la

Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

So come over now and talk me down

I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now

The less you need to heal
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now

So come over now and talk me down

I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Grey areas
And expectations

1644,1644,Shawn Mendes,A Little Too Much,"She would not show that she was afraid,
But being and feeling alone was too much to face,
Though everyone said that she was so strong,
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on,

But she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much,

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and we'll be alright

And she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,

Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah.

A little too much, I said a little too much, oh.

Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool

Running on the music

Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly

And far enough to have some time to see

All these possibilities, oh these possibilities
Are written in the stars, we are who we are baby
And I can't help but think that possibly
There's possibility

Don't give me hope if there's nothing to this
Don't let me in if you're not there
What I'm feeling doesn't happen every day
So baby, please play me fair

And it feels like there's something more
Than those crazy little crushes I've felt before
When you move in closer I can feel the rush
And now we're so close we can touch

All these possibilities
So many little possibilities
Right in front of us, close enough to touch
And far enough to have some time to see

All these possibilities, oh these possibilities
Are written in the stars, we are who we are baby
And I can't help but think that possibly
There's possibility"
1655,1655,Lord Huron,The Night We Met,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"
1657,1657,Fifth Harmony,Who Are You,"Lauren:
Monday, you sent me flowers
Tuesday, made me feel stupid
Wednesday, the world was ours
Thursday, you didn't prove it

Normani:
Friday, fell back in love
Saturday, we didn't talk
Sunday, you said you needed space

Ally:
Do you miss me? Am I crazy?
Am I losing hold of your love baby?

Camila:
Either you want me or you don't
I need to know, I need to know

Dinah:
Who are you today?
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?
Who are you tomorrow?
Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?
Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?
Who are you today?
'Cause I am still the same

Normani:
Monday, you had my heart
Tuesday, you had me screaming
Wednesday, we didn't part
Thursday, you didn't mean it

Lauren:
Friday, I shook it off

Ally:
Saturday, you got it wrong

Normani:
Sunday, I said I needed space

Ally:
Do you miss me? Am I crazy?
Am I losing hold of your love baby?

Either you want me or you don't
I need to know, I need to know

Dinah:
Who are you today?
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?
Who are you tomorrow?

Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?
Who are you today?
'Cause I am still the same

All:
Who are you? Who are you?

Dinah:
It's so strange how the same thing
Can make you feel so right
And bring you so much pain
It's so strange how the same face
Can make you love until it hurts

Camila:
Where do we go? (Ally: Where do we go?)
I need to know (Ally: I need to know)

Dinah (Ally ad-libs):
Who are you today? 
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?
Who are you tomorrow?
Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?
Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?
Who are you today?
'Cause I am still the same
Oh yeah yeah, 
The same"
