Stevie Wonder,"Like a fool I went and stayed too long<br/>
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong<br/>
Oo baby, here I am,<br/>
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours<br/>
Then that time I went and said goodbye<br/>
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry<br/>
Oo baby, here I am,<br/>
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours<br/>
<br/>
Here I am baby<br/>
Oh, you've got the future in your hand<br/>
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)<br/>
<br/>
Here I am baby,<br/>
Oh, you've got the future in your hand<br/>
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)<br/>
<br/>
I've done alot of foolish things<br/>
That I really didn't mean<br/>
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby<br/>
<br/>
Seen alot of things in this old world<br/>
When I touched them they did nothing, girl<br/>
<br/>
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered,<br/>
I'm yours, oh I'm yours<br/>
Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire<br/>
That's why I know you are my only desire<br/>
<br/>
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered,<br/>
I'm yours Here I am baby<br/>
Oh, you've got the future in your hand<br/>
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)<br/>
<br/>
Here I am baby,<br/>
Oh, you've got the future in your hand<br/>
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)<br/>
<br/>
I've done alot of foolish things<br/>
That I really didn't mean<br/>
I could be a broken man but here I am<br/>
<br/>
With your future, got your future babe (here I am baby)<br/>
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)<br/>
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)<br/>
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)<br/>

Let me tell ya now<br/>
Uh-huh<br/>
(Mmhhmmm)<br/>
<br/>
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around<br/>
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd<br/>
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took<br/>
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby, give me one more chance<br/>
(To show you that I love you)<br/>
Won't you please let me back in your heart<br/>
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go<br/>
(Let you go, baby)<br/>
But now since I see you in his arms<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Yes I do now<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Ooh ooh baby<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Na na na na<br/>
<br/>
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night<br/>
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right<br/>
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground<br/>
Following the girl I didn't even want around<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell ya now<br/>
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance<br/>
(To show you that I love you)<br/>
Won't you please let me back in your heart<br/>
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go<br/>
(Let you go, baby)<br/>
But now since I see you in his arms<br/>
<br/>
All I want...<br/>
All I need...<br/>
All I want!<br/>
All I need!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, just one more chance<br/>
To show you that I love you<br/>
Baby baby baby baby baby baby!<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Forget what happened then<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
And let me live again!<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go<br/>
But now since I see you in his arms<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Spare me of this cause<br/>
(I want you back)<br/>
Give me back what I lost!<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby, I need one more chance, hah<br/>
I tell you that I love you<br/>
Baby, oh! Baby, oh! Baby, oh!<br/>

It's a game of give and take<br/>

No, you just have to wait<br/>

To let me live again<br/>
Right now the only thing<br/>
That keeps me hangin' on<br/>

It's almost gone<br/>

You can't hurry love<br/>
No, you just have to wait<br/>
She said love don't come easy<br/>
It's a game of give and take<br/>

How long must I wait<br/>
How much more can I take<br/>
Before loneliness will cause my heart<br/>
Heart to break?<br/>
<br/>
No I can't bear to live my life alone<br/>
I grow impatient for a love to call my own<br/>
But when I feel that I, I can't go on<br/>
These precious words keeps me hangin' on<br/>
I remember mama said:<br/>

No, love, love don't come easy<br/>
But I keep on waiting<br/>
Anticipating for that soft voice<br/>
To talk to me at night<br/>
For some tender arms<br/>
To hold me tight<br/>
I keep waiting<br/>
I keep on waiting<br/>
But it ain't easy<br/>

<br/><br/>",You Can't Hurry Love
Stevie Wonder,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me<br/>
Someone I've needed so long<br/>
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me<br/>
And somehow I know I'll be strong<br/>
<br/>
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of<br/>
Long before I knew<br/>
Someone warm like you<br/>
Would make my dreams come true<br/>
<br/>
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me<br/>
Not like it's hurt me before<br/>
For once, I have something I know won't desert me<br/>
I'm not alone anymore<br/>
<br/>
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it<br/>
As long as I know I have love, I can make it<br/>
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Stevie Wonder,"Music is a world within itself<br/>
With a language we all understand<br/>
With an equal opportunity<br/>
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands<br/>
But just because a record has a groove<br/>
Don't make it in the groove<br/>
But you can tell right away at letter A<br/>
When the people start to move<br/>
<br/>
They can feel it all over<br/>
They can feel it all over people<br/>
They can feel it all over<br/>
They can feel it all over people<br/>
<br/>
Music knows it is and always will<br/>
Be one of the things that life just won't quit<br/>
But here are some of music's pioneers<br/>
That time will not allow us to forget<br/>
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo<br/>
And the king of all Sir Duke<br/>
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out<br/>
There's no way the band can lose<br/>
<br/>
You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>
You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>
<br/>
You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>
You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>

You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>
You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>

You can feel it all over<br/>
You can feel it all over people<br/>
You can feel it all over<br/>
I can feel it all over-all over now people<br/>

Can't you feel it all over<br/>

Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks,<br/>
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back,<br/>
But I'm the envy of ev'ry single guy<br/>
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.<br/>
When we go out stepping on the town for a while<br/>
My money's low and my suit's out of style,<br/>
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new<br/>
Out of sight because my heart is true.<br/>
<br/>
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, out of sight.<br/>
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,<br/>
I guess her folks brought her up that way,<br/>
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised<br/>
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.<br/>
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy,<br/>
No football hero or smooth Don Juan,<br/>
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son.<br/>
She says give her the things that money can buy<br/>
But I'll never, never make my baby cry,<br/>
<br/>
And it's all right, what I can't do,<br/>
Out of sight because my heart is true,<br/>

A lovely day.....<br/>
<br/>
When the day that lies ahead of me<br/>
Seems impossible to face<br/>
When someone else instead of me<br/>
Always seems to know the way<br/>
<br/>
Then I look at you<br/>
And the world's alright with me<br/>
Just one look at you<br/>
And I know it's gonna be<br/>
A lovely day......

Mary Wells,"Nothing you can say can tear me away<br/>
From my guy<br/>
Nothing you could do, 'cause I'm stuck like glue<br/>
To my guy<br/>
<br/>
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter<br/>
Like birds of a feather we stick together<br/>
I'm tellin' you from the start<br/>
I can't be torn apart from my guy<br/>
<br/>
Nothing you could do could make me be untrue<br/>
To my guy (my guy)<br/>
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie<br/>
To my guy (my guy)<br/>
<br/>
I gave my guy my word of honor<br/>
To be faithful and I'm gonna<br/>
You'd best be believing<br/>
I won't be deceiving my guy<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops<br/>
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop<br/>
As a matter of taste to be exact<br/>
He's my ideal as a matter of fact<br/>
<br/>
No muscle bound man could take my hand<br/>
From my guy (my guy)<br/>
No handsome face could ever take the place<br/>
Of my guy (my guy)<br/>
<br/>
He may not be a movie star<br/>
But when it comes to being happy, we are<br/>
There's not a man today who can take me away<br/>
From my guy<br/>
